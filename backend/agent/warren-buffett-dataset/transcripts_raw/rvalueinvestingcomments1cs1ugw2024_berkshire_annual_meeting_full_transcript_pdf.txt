 2024 Berkshire Annual Meeting Full Transcript (PDF)
 

 Buffett
 

 Hi All,
 

 Long time lurker, first time poster. The Warren Buffett Archive at CNBC still doesn't have the transcript up from the 2024 meeting so I thought I'd share a PDF for anyone that is interested.
 

 This is an edited version of the transcript posted on Steady Compounding, so thank you to the folks there as well. My edits include a transcript of Warren's video commemorating Charlie before the meeting begins, some light edits of errant language, and edits identifying the speaker.
 

Full video of the meeting, including CNBC Coverage

PDF of Transcript Here

 Hope you all get some value from it, pun intended!
