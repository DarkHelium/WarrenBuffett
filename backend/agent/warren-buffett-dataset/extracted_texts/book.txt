What I Learned from  
My Father’s Writings

This book grows on you. I know because it grew on me. It took me 
about ﬁfteen years to understand Common Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts. 
When I ﬁrst read the book, it made darned little sense. I was eight. It 
was a waste of the start of a perfectly good summer vacation.Too many 
big words that required I use a dictionary—ugh. But it was my father’s 
book, and I was proud of him. I had heard at school and from neigh­ 
bors  and  had  read  in  the  local  paper  that  his  book  was  making  a  big 
splash. I was told that it was the very ﬁrst investment book ever to have 
made the New York Times bestseller list, whatever that meant. I felt it was 
my absolute duty to read it. So I did, and when completed, I was glad  
to be ﬁnished and free for the summer. 

Who  knew  that  I  would  later  go  on  to  found  a  large  investment 
management  ﬁrm  serving  thousands  of  clients,  write  my  own  books,  
and  become  the  sixth­longest­running  columnist  in  Forbes  magazine’s 
formidable  eighty­plus­year  history  or  that  I  would  write  numerous 
annual “Best  of  the Year”  investment  book  reviews  and  recommend 
dozens of books over the decades to readers? And, yes, maybe it helped 
in route that I could say I’d read my ﬁrst investment book when I was 
eight, even if I didn’t understand it. 

The book next seriously crossed my mind at age twenty as I faced 
college graduation. Father had offered me a job working with him and 

x i

x i i  

my older brother. Anxious, but skeptical, I was curious to see if this job 
was really an opportunity. So, I read Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits 
again. (There were only a few words I didn’t understand this time.) 

Reading  about  my  father’s  ﬁfteen  points  to  look  for  in  a  stock,  I 
wondered  if  I  could  apply  them  to  a  local  stock.  If  so,  I  thought  this 
would afﬁrm the beneﬁt of working with my father. 

Well, it didn’t work.There was a local publicly­traded lumber stock, 
Paciﬁc Lumber, that looked like a good proﬁt opportunity. But the few 
folks  I  approached  weren’t  impressed  with  some  wanna­be  kid­sleuth 
seeking competitive detail who was clearly ill­prepared to analyze or do 
anything with it. I didn’t even know how to ask meaningful questions. 
After being shut out by the ﬁrst few folks I approached with my fact­ 
seeking questions, I gave up. But it showed me that I needed quite a bit 
of polishing. 

Working for my father was a bumpy ride, a bit like my ﬁrst profes­ 
sional  stock  purchase—a  reverse “ten  bagger”:  it  fell  from  ten  to  one. 
I  tell  you  all  this  only  so  you  can  see  that  even  a  kid  in  his  twenties, 
without a lifetime at the top of his school class, having never attended a 
big­name university, and with no major accomplishments under his belt 
to brag on, even that kid could go on and in just a few years learn to 
effectively use the principles in this book. And so can you. 

THE FIFTEEN POINTS 

Ultimately, when you’re a young man starting out in the industry as I was 
and  haven’t  yet  bought  any  stocks,  ﬁguring  out  what  to  buy  seems 
immediately more important than ﬁguring out what to sell. Fortunately, 
this book teaches that if you ﬁgure out the right things to buy, selling 
becomes a lot less important because you can hold the stocks you own 
longer. And what to buy derives directly from my father’s ﬁfteen points. 
Applying his ﬁfteen points was a repeatable real­world experience 
linked to “scuttlebutt,” as he described it, all aimed at researching one 
stock  here,  another  there. And  it  worked.  I  will  not  here  recount  in  
detail the successes that the ﬁfteen points helped me achieve early in my 
career.  But  I  gained  tremendous  career  momentum  by  discovering  a 
handful of great stocks that did wonderful things for me. From the ﬁf­ 
teen points, I could fathom generally where a ﬁrm ﬁt into the world 
and how it would or wouldn’t prosper. If it wouldn’t, what might its hic­ 
cups  be?  I  soon  understood  why  my  college  try  at  the  ﬁfteen  points 

Preface 

 x i i i 

failed. The craft is in the scuttlebutt, which, like all craft, takes time to 
learn. Scuttlebutt is simply about ﬁnding out from real, “Main Street” 
sources if a ﬁrm is strong or weak. Most folks don’t use this approach, 
relying instead on the local rumor mill and Wall Street noise, most of 
which is aimed at selling you product. 

As the century ended and a new one began, the power of scuttle­ 
butt should have been obvious to folks, but it wasn’t. If you had applied 
the ﬁfteen points in this book and got your information sources from 
“Main Street” instead of Wall Street, you would never have bought any  
of the scandal stocks that so penetrated the news of the 2000–2002 bear 
market.  The  likes  of  Enron,  Tyco,  and  WorldCom  are  always  easily 
avoided. Those who fell for these stocks depended on gossip and Wall 
Street opinion rather than on “Main Street” veriﬁcation of the business’s  
strengths. The  ﬁfteen  points  are  about  very  fundamental  business  fea­
tures that can’t be faked. Scuttlebutt means avoiding malarkey mills and 
seeking information from competitors, customers, and suppliers, all of 
whom have a vested interest in the target company, and few of whom 
have any reason to see the ﬁrm unrealistically. It means talking to the 
sales representatives of a company’s competitors, who inherently have a 
basis to see the target company negatively but typically don’t if the target 
is great. It means talking to the research people and management people 
of competitors as well. If all those folks see reality and strength in the 
target’s operations and respect it and even fear it, well, simply said, it isn’t 
Enron or Adelphia.You can count on it. 

Scuttlebutt itself can be a sort of art form that identiﬁes character­
izations  of  the  ﬁfteen  points.  It’s  the  difference  between  learning  to 
play the piano (craft) and then composing (art). Art takes time to learn. 
You probably won’t compose until you’re pretty competent at playing. 
In almost any ﬁeld, you can learn craft by repetition, but not otherwise. 
You may appreciate the art without any ability to create it yourself. Or, 
after mastering craft, you may turn yourself into an artist. But this book 
allows you to sense the art, and fortunately it doesn’t take that long to 
learn because a lot of it is common sense. The problem for most folks 
is that they don’t know that this common sense can be applied, and 
hence they don’t try. But Common Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts shows 
you how. 

Think about the ﬁfteen points for a moment. I know,you haven’t read 
them yet. Let me describe in a straightforward way what they prescribe, 
and you will immediately see how universally desirable the attributes are. 
You can read them in more detail in my father’s words and savor them.

 
x i v  

My father’s ﬁfteen points are a prescription for what to buy. They 
describe a ﬁrm with huge product and market potential and a manage­
ment determined to continue exploiting that potential far beyond the 
current product generation. The prescription means an existing research 
effectiveness  to  create  future  product,  linked  to  a  sales­force  size  and 
efﬁciency that will overcome all obstacles in carrying existing and future 
product to market. That is very futuristic. It means enough raw product 
proﬁtability, combining gross proﬁt margins and the ratio of gross profits 
to  administrative  costs  to  pay  for  the  whole  darned  thing.  It  means  a  
real,  concrete  plan  to  maintain  and  to  improve  that  proﬁtability  and  
happy employees at all levels, in depth, who will be loyal and produc­
tive, again futuristic and open­ended, never ending. Then, too, it means 
tight, great cost controls and some aspect, peculiar to its industry, that 
allows the target to excel relative to others in the industry. And, ﬁnally,  
all that must be wrapped up and guided by an open, articulate manage­
ment of unquestionable integrity. 

Consider  the  scandal  stocks  or  other  overvalued  portfolios.  Not  a 
one could have passed the test via scuttlebutt because if you talked to 
competitors,  they  weren’t  overly  scared  of  those  slinky  ﬁrms.  If  you 
talked  to  customers  or  suppliers,  they  weren’t  overly  impressed  either. 
The customers weren’t impressed because the products weren’t all that 
good by relative comparison.The venders and suppliers weren’t all that 
impressed because the vendors’ other customers would have been doing 
better and ordering more—the real sales volume wasn’t there. And the 
competitors would not have held these ﬁrms in awe because they were 
not held by them at competitive disadvantage. 

Not only would the ﬁfteen points have easily eliminated all scandal 
stocks of the 2000–2002 bear market, they would have also eliminated 
all the so­called 95 percent club—the tech stocks that lost 95 percent or 
more of their value during the bear market because they were internet 
pipe­dreams,  or  whatever,  with  basically  1999  hype  but  nothing  real 
there. Think of how many internet stocks had no real sales force (and 
certainly none to intimidate a competitor), and no proﬁt margin at all, 
and  no  plan  to  achieve  proﬁtability  much  less  improve  it,  and  no 
fundamental  research,  and  no  ability  to  exist  without  future  equity 
ﬁnancing. And, and, and.They couldn’t have made it on half the ﬁfteen 
points. Then, too, the ﬁfteen points by exclusion would have eliminated 
quite  a  lot  of  other  companies.  But  think  of  the  ﬁrms  of  the  prior 
decades that the ﬁfteen points would not have eliminated. They would 

Preface 

 x v 

have  hooked  you  into  real  ﬁrms,  whether  cheap  or  expensive,  and 
would have allowed you to navigate the tricky currents of ﬁnancial mar­ 
ket  volatility  whether  your  own  personal  inclinations  were  toward 
growth stocks or value stocks, small stocks or big ones. 

GOALS VERSUS SCUTTLEBUTT

My father’s goals and mine were never the same. But this book works 
for both our goals—and for yours, too. My father was almost always a 
growth­stock investor—almost always. It was simply who he was. I was, 
in my youth, for a variety of reasons a value guy. These days, I’m nei­
ther a value, growth, big cap, or small cap guy. I’m kind of prone to go 
any which way I want, but that is a different story and not for this book. 
Anyway, as a youth and a value guy, the ﬁfteen points served me nicely, 
getting me into high­quality ﬁrms with cheap stocks that as businesses 
did spectacularly but that were overlooked as stocks in the mid­1970’s. 
He wanted stock in a ﬁrm that could grow and grow and grow, and he 
wanted stock that could be bought at a reasonable price and virtually 
never be sold. I wanted a dirt cheap stock that was a great ﬁrm with a 
bad Wall Street image, a stock that could grow fundamentally and have 
a price to multiple expansion so it could be sold at a premium multiple 
or a big markup in ﬁve to ten years. 

My point: Scuttlebutt and the ﬁfteen points work for growth stocks 
or value stocks, for big cap stocks or small cap stocks. Take point four: 
An above­average sales organization is as important, or maybe more so,  
to a value ﬁrm without great natural sales momentum behind it as it is 
to one with the wind to its back. It is also critical for a small ﬁrm that  
wants to overcome larger brethren. And an above­average sales organ­
ization is hard to accomplish but needed for a huge ﬁrm that wants to 
stave off a myriad of small venture­capital­funded wanna­bes swarm­
ing mass capital after its market. Ditto for point ﬁve about a worth­ 
while proﬁt margin. For example, in a commodity­type business, with­
out  natural  growth,  it  is  true  that  market  share,  relative  production  
costs, and long­term proﬁt margins all tend to be pretty tightly linked. 
Good management gains market share and lowers relative production  
costs,  often  by  introducing  enhanced  production  technology  (the 
application of technology rather than the production of it). Bad man­
agement  simply  but  irregularly  lowers  margins  until  they  disappear. 

 
x v i  

Hence,  in  1976,  I  discovered  Nucor,  a  tiny  low­cost  steel  vendor— 
great management, innovative technology, lower production cost, high 
relative  market  share  in  tiny  steel  niches,  gaining  market  share,  and 
adding niches. I bought it as a value guy; my father followed me and 
promptly bought Nucor as a growth guy. Same ﬁfteen points. I sold 
some years later at a huge proﬁt, and my father held it for decades, selling 
at a much larger proﬁt, by which time it had become the second­largest 
U.S. steel manufacturer. 

I think my father, who was ﬁfty­one when this book came out and 
a bit of an eclectic genius and already very successful, failed to see how 
the understanding of the craft, turning into an art, which had come to 
him slowly and intuitively over the years, would take time for a neo­
phyte to learn. He regularly thought of things in his life differently than 
how he initially explained them. It was a quirky part of how his brain 
worked. As I write today, I am ﬁfty­two, almost the same age as he was 
then; and I know, because I had to learn the process rather than invent 
it, that it takes time to learn. 

I’m more linear than my father was and in many ways more intro­ 
spective, and I urge you to read this book multiple times spanning your 
investment  life. Take  scuttlebutt,  again. The  scuttlebutt  chapter  is  only 
three pages long. But they are among the book’s most important pages. 
It is clear to me, in retrospect, that my father simply skipped the craft part  
of what otherwise might have been in the book. He just assumed it. 

Over the years, I applied this process to lots of stocks on an indi­ 
vidual basis, gaining great insights.The key? Focus on customers, com­ 
petitors, and suppliers. I described the craft in my ﬁrst book, Super Stocks 
(Dow Jones­Irwin,1984),including how to do it with several real­world 
examples.  My  book  was  a  good  book,  1984–1985’s  best­selling  stock 
market book. And I’m proud I wrote it. But it was not nearly as good 
as  this  book.  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon  Proﬁts  had  much  less  that 
would become obsolete over time than my ﬁrst book  had;  and while 
both  books  introduced  new  concepts,  my  father’s  new  concepts  were 
more radical for their day and more uniformly applied and more time­
less—which is what makes it such a great book. My book was mostly 
about craft, not art. With craft, whenever you ask, you get answers. The  
art is to get more questions—and the right questions—ﬂowing from the 
answers you receive to prior questions. I’ve seen people who rigidly run 
down a standard question list, regardless of the responses they get. That 
isn’t art: You ask; he or she answers. What question best ﬂows from the 

Preface

 x v i i 

answer? And so on.When you can do that well on a real­time basis, you 
are  a  composer,  an  artist,  a  creative  and  investigative  investor. That  is 
what my father in his prime did best. 

I  went  with  my  father  about  a  jillion  times  to  visit  companies 
between 1972 and 1982. I worked for him for only a year, but we did 
lots of things together after that. In looking at companies, he always pre­ 
pared  questions  in  advance,  typed  on  yellow  pages  with  space  in  
between so he could scribble notes. He always wanted to be prepared, 
and he wanted the company to know he was prepared so they would 
appreciate him. And he used the questions as a sort of outline of topics 
to be covered. It was also a great backup in case the conversation went 
cold, which occasionally it did. Then he could get things back on course 
instantly with one of his prepared questions. But his very best questions 
always popped out of his mind, unprepared, never having been written 
down in advance because they were the angle he picked up on the ﬂy, 
as he heard an answer to a lesser question.Those creative questions were 
the art. It is what, in my mind, made his querying great. 

His  mind  was  ﬁnancially  facile  until  he  was  pretty  darned  old.  I 
want to tell you about one of the best questions I never heard him use  
in person and only heard about later from James Michaels. It wasn’t in 
his books, but it would have made a great addition anywhere. 

A great honor of my life was that for ﬁfteen years before his retire­
ment  I  was  edited  personally  in  Forbes  by  the  great  James  Walker 
Michaels, who at his retirement as editor of Forbes in 1998 was beyond 
doubt the dean of U.S. business journalism. He brought me into Forbes, 
took a personal interest in me, and edited virtually every column I wrote 
by himself (which is rare for a periodical editor) until his retirement as 
editor. He also admired my father greatly. Once, and only once, Jim and 
I had a reason to spend a weekend together on the West Coast, and he 
hoped  to  come  a  few  hours  early  and  sit  down  with  my  father,  who  
then would have been just shy of eighty­nine. 

They met for a few hours in a conference room at my ﬁrm’s head­ 
quarters on top of Kings Mountain, in California. Jim and I then drove 
north a few hours toward the Russian River and our destination; and en 
route Jim kept asking me about “that question.” I had no clue what he 
was talking about, and I knew my father better than anyone in the world. 
It embarrassed me that I had no idea what he was seeking from me. For 
about an hour, Jim staggered trying to put it together and pretty much gave 
up. As often happens with our minds, when he quit trying, it popped  

 
x v i i i  

right out, and he said, “What are you doing that your competitors aren’t 
doing yet?” What a great question! The emphasis was on the word yet. 
Staggering.  Most  folks,  when  you  ask  them  that  question,  aren’t  doing 
one  darned  thing  of  any  great  signiﬁcance  their  competitors  aren’t 
already doing and feel awestruck that you asked them this and they hadn’t 
thought of it themselves. 

The  ﬁrm  that  is  always  asking  itself  that  question  never  becomes 
complacent.  It  is  never  caught  behind.  It  never  starves  for  intellectual 
grist to chew through toward a better future. It is the ﬁrm that, coupled 
with  integrity  and  raw  management  intellect,  lives  the  ﬁfteen  points. 
“What are you doing that your competitors aren’t doing yet?” implies 
driving the product market, forcing others to follow, and dominating for 
the betterment of customers, employees, and shareholders, which is sheer 
greatness. Jim’s question both summed up my father’s lifelong aspirations 
and summarized the gist of his ﬁfteen points. And where he got it from  
I still don’t know to this day. But it is a stunningly­cunning question. 

Jim, who always had a nose for the twist that made a great story, 
returned to New York after our weekend and composed a Forbes article 
wrapped  around  that  question.  It  combined  the  best  of  Jim  and  my 
father, and the whole thing reminded me of how often in my life I was 
the  plodding,  mechanical  ﬂy­wheel  around  my  father’s  eclectic  bril­ 
liance. I’m not meaning to demean myself. I’ve done very well in life; 
but I am more linear, more deductive, harder working, more driven, and 
more direct than my father, who was vastly more a non­linear genius. 

My  ﬁrm  has  applied  the  ﬁfteen  points  and  scuttlebutt  to  ﬁrms  of 
most  varieties,  although  primarily  smaller,  beat­up  ones.  Retailers, 
technology  companies  of  various  forms,  service  ﬁrms,  concrete,  steel, 
specialty  chemicals,  consumer  products,  gambling,  you  name  it.  The 
ﬁfteen  points  hasn’t  always  been  the  ﬁnal  decisive  phenomena  that 
compelled me or the ﬁrm, but they often added value. I’ve always felt 
free to pretty much do my own thing.While contemplating on a large 
scale and attempting to reach conclusions on hundreds of stock yearly, 
my  ﬁrm  mass­produced  the  process  for  many  years  in  a  process  we  
called  Twelve­Call,  which  was  run  off  an  operations  manual  with  
remote­location  workers  doing  telephone  interviews  of  customers, 
competitors, and suppliers. It wasn’t as powerful by far as doing it your­
self on a single stock, but it let us cover lots of ground. Today, we have 
replaced  that  with  subsequent  capital­markets  technology;  but  that  is, 
again, another story and outside the scope of this book. 

Preface 

 x i x 

Today my ﬁrm is managing many, many billions of dollars aimed at 
a handful of different goals while buying stocks around the globe and 
using 500­plus employees. You probably aren’t doing that.You therefore 
shouldn’t do what I’m doing, and I shouldn’t do what you need to do.  
If you’re an individual, all of the ﬁfteen points still apply. Tactically, you 
use them the way I did as a young man when I didn’t have the machine  
I have today. And you can’t cover the turf I now can, but that probably 
isn’t  necessary  or  even  desirable  to  you.  My  point  is  that  the  ﬁfteen  
points  are  worthwhile  whether  used  exactly  as  my  father  originally 
envisioned  them  or  on  an  altered,  more  superﬁcial  but  more  mass­ 
spectrum basis, for domestic or foreign stocks, for growth or value, or, 
for that matter, if you move away from public stocks to buy private busi­
nesses, many or just that one that you might want to own and operate 
personally, no matter how small. All of the same principles apply. 

MUCH MORE AVAILABLE 

Now, don’t get the idea that the only worthwhile parts of Common Stocks 
and Uncommon Proﬁts are scuttlebutt and the ﬁfteen points. It’s just that I 
think  they  are  the  jewels. There  are  smaller  sparkles,  too,  bits  of  wis­
dom well worn. For example, by 1990 I’d been a professional for eigh­
teen years and fairly successful. I’d been a Forbes columnist for six years. 
Enter Saddam Hussein. As the threat of war grew, investors grew timid. 
The market buckled. I’ve studied quite a bit of history and written two 
ﬁnancial history books. The history as I saw it said,“Buy.” But I hadn’t 
lived that much history. One weekend, I buttressed my resolve by review­
ing Chapter Eight,“Five Don’ts for Investors,” and Chapter Nine,“Five 
More Don’ts for Investors,” in Part One. And I knew that the war scare 
had to be a market buying opportunity. From it, along with some of my 
economic  forecasting,  came  my  well­timed  late­1990 “buy”  columns. 
Timing  that  right,  when  most  others  were  bearish,  helped  secure  my 
long­term place in Forbes, for which I’ve always been grateful. But you 
might  have  found  the  same  things  useful  more  recently  as  we  had  
the 2000–2002 bear market and what could be thought of as Saddam 
Hussein II. 

As  I  write,  in  2002,  we  have  had  the  worst  bear  market  since, 
depending on how you look at it, my early career in 1974 or the Great 
Depression  in  1937–1938.  Many  have  had  their  faith  in  prior  

 
x x  

investment beliefs shattered. Many have developed new­found faith in 
other concepts that they will soon surely ﬁnd shallow, vapid, and void  
of eternal truth.What would my father say looking forward. He would 
say  simply  that  capitalism  will  prevail  and  the  United  States  and  the 
Western  world  will  progress,  that  you  can  debate  where  the  market  
bottom is, and that he rarely considered himself to be very good at that 
(although he made a few spectacular market calls in his long career). He 
would say that if you own companies that have the ﬁfteen points and 
don’t get carried away by what he referred to as “fads and fancies,” you 
will come through this period just ﬁne. He would say that if you don’t 
own stocks, this is a perfectly ﬁne time to buy companies that possess 
his  ﬁfteen  points. The  bear  market  of  2000–2002  has  seen  to  that.  
Might they go lower before they go up? He would always acknowledge 
that possibility. But he would say that it won’t matter much a few years 
from  now. Would  he  contemplate  cutting,  running,  and  selling  out  to 
avoid the market here? Not for a moment. There is nothing he would  
be less likely to do. Yes, he did lighten up on stocks several times in his  
ultra­long  career,  but  only  when  he  could  know  that  the  market  
hadn’t fallen yet and still might, not after it had fallen, hoping it would 
fall still more. 

Would my father fear Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, or ter­ 
rorists?  No. Would  he  fear  war?  He  tells  you  directly  in  these  pages 
that  he  would  not. Would  he  admire  President  Bush  for  pointing  us 
toward war? No. He rarely admired presidents because he saw them as 
politicians and he came to not much care for politicians; and the few  
he ever cared for weren’t so high up. He said, “The higher they go, the  
liar they get.” And he hated war and rarely could see its justiﬁcation. 
Would he have worried about the myriad of other negatives in con­ 
temporary media, like corporate integrity, double­dip recession possi­
bilities, high market price­earnings ratios, the risk of Brazil defaulting,  
or whatever? No, not much. He would have used this time while oth­
ers focused on the wrong things to refocus on the basic fundamentals 
of  the  ﬁrms  he  owned  and  to  see  if  he  should  still  own  them. And 
in looking at the weakest among them, he would be contemplating if 
there  were  one  or  two  better  ﬁrms  he  could  ﬁnd  somewhere  to  
replace them. He always saw volatile, down markets as a great oppor­ 
tunity  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  his  few  stocks. And  the  more  folks 
fretted about the market, the more he would be fretting about what  
he owned and didn’t own. 

Preface

Late in his career when asked about market timing or sector issues, 
he would say something like,“Well, my son has proven he can navigate 
those waters much better than I’ve ever been able to, and here is what he 
says . . . but, I still wouldn’t trust him.” He never trusted anyone to make 
those kinds of decisions for him. He trusted the ownership of ﬁrms that 
possessed his ﬁfteen points to take care of him. And he would today. 

Many  times  in  my  career,  someone  would  tell  me  (a)  that  I  was 
wrong (which may have been and always may be quite true) and (b) that 
my father never would have done what I’m doing. I would always know 
generally that this person clearly didn’t know my father’s brain one iota 
as well as I did and that he or she almost certainly hadn’t read his writ­
ings as often as I had. So, I never much worried about people’s assess­
ment of what my father would and wouldn’t have done. My point here 
is that even being the one who knew him best, in a business sense, I read 
him more than most. Even if you understand the material really well,  
you  will  beneﬁt  from  rereading  these  pages  multiple  times  as  your 
investing life progresses, and you will hurt yourself if you rely solely on 
the lessons from one reading. First, they fade in your mind. Second, the 
more you read them, the more you get out of them.Without meaning 
to sound heretical, it is like a little investing bible—a book that is meant 
to be read multiple times and whose usefulness does not end with the 
last page. 

You will ﬁnd lots of other jewels of your own in these pages that 
may do as much for you as they have for me. But an important con­ 
cluding  point  to  make  on  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon  Proﬁts  is  to 
note its sheer fundamentalness. Not only does it teach the true basics of  
fundamentals of investing, but it has also been a core part of the training of 
many leading investment practitioners. For many years, it has been part 
of  the  curriculum  in  the  investment  class  at  the  Stanford  Graduate 
School of Business. Students of all forms passed through Stanford, read 
the book, and went on to become some of the nation’s leading investors. 
But  the  book’s  breadth  was  broader  than  that.  For  example, Warren  
Buffett has long credited my father and Common Stocks and Uncommon 
Proﬁts as being fundamental to the development of his investment phi­
losophy. The  ﬁrst  of  my  father’s “Don’ts”  in  Chapter  Nine—“Don’t 
overstress  diversiﬁcation”—gets  you  quickly  to  a  key  cornerstone  of 
Buffettism. And you can ﬁnd it in the very same place Buffett ﬁrst did. 
Not much of great importance to market fundamentalism changed 
between the writing of my father’s ﬁrst book and that of his third and 

 
x x i i  

last book, Conservative Investors Sleep Well. But a lot of water went under 
the investment bridge: a huge bull market, a huge bear market, 1958 to 
1974—lots  of  fads  and  fancies.  By  then  my  father  was  sixty­seven.  
His last book was good, but it wasn’t nearly what Common Stocks and 
Uncommon Proﬁts was. He had done it so well the ﬁrst time that his two 
subsequent books only made incremental additions. If you can read only 
one of my father’s writing, let it be his ﬁrst book. It was his best. Still, if 
you want to read more from my father, his next most important writ­ 
ing was his last book. It was also contributing fundamental ideas. It was 
a bit topical at the time but has remained timeless. 

I think in Conservative Investors Sleep Well that Chapter Six’s Motorola 
section is vintage Phil Fisher. In it, he shows why Motorola, which others 
then didn’t like so well, was a great ﬁrm and one for which he was per­
sonally ready to put his neck on the line in thinking forward a very long 
time. It’s tough to read this section of that book and not appreciate that 
Motorola was a true quality company. But look what happened after­
ward.  In  the  next  twenty­ﬁve  years,  the  stock  appreciated  thirty­fold, 
that is, before dividends—and all in a safe, well­managed ﬁrm, incurring 
no  brokerage  costs  year  to  year,  no  mutual  fund  operating  expense  
ratios, and not much effort for a true believer. How often does some­ 
one give you a successful multi­decade­long look­ahead? Darned near 
never. Would anyone actually hold one stock for all those twenty­ﬁve 
years? Well, I’m here to tell you for a certainty that one Philip A. Fish­ 
er did, as his largest personal holding, all the while it was trouncing the 
Standard  &  Poor’s  500. And  that  is  and  was  what  Phil  Fisher  was  all 
about. Finding a very few great companies that he could really know 
and holding them for a long, long, long time while those very stocks 
appreciated phenomenally. Conservative Investors Sleep Well is simply the 
best treatise I know on how to buy and hold growth stocks without tak­
ing much risk. You could get that, certainly, from either book, his ﬁrst  
or his third. The two in many ways are intellectually linked at the bod­
ies, separated by sixteen years. Still, if you only read one, read Common 
Stocks.  It  offers  more,  is  more  radical  for  its  time,  is  better  written,  is  
more timeless, covers more turf, and is more intellectual. If you can read 
both, do it. 

In the book’s second preface, I tell you a little about my father that  
isn’t well known. But over the years, people often asked me about my  
relationship with my father, father and son having been in the same  
industry  and  all  that. And  because  he  was  weird,  and  I’m  weird,  and  

Preface 

 x x i i i 

often  they  are  weird,  I  sometimes  give  weird  answers.  For  example,  
when they asked, as they often did, what experience from my memo­
ries with my father is my favorite, I regularly answered, “The next one.” 
That is no more, but it was for a long time. They often tried to pin me 
down with something like,“Well, weren’t there favorite moments when 
you  were  younger?”  I  readily  admit  there  were.  He  was  the  world’s 
greatest bedtime storyteller, and his stories had absolutely nothing at all 
to do with the stock market. Many were his own ﬁctional creations. As 
a small child, I loved every moment of those stories—and folks like the 
growing  legions  of  Buffett­philes  hate  that  answer. They  want  some 
notion about researching some stock. But there was never really a lot of 
emotion about that. It was just work. So, then, in frustration, I’m often 
asked, “Well, if you could distill advice from your father down to a single 
sentence, what would it be?” I’d say, “Read his writings and try to live 
them out.” And that is what you get with these pages. Enjoy them.

and Other Writings

Introduction

Kenneth L. Fisher

This is among the most beloved investment books of all times, among 
the bestselling of classic investment books, and now forty-ﬁve years old.  
My father wrote his original preface at my childhood home in September 
1957. It remains herein. Forty-ﬁve years later in October 2002, in my 
current home, I dare write this, this book’s ﬁrst new preface in all those 
decades. 

If  you’ve  read  my  revised  preface,  you  might  think  my  father  is 
deceased. No. As I write, he is ninety-ﬁve and alive. But he is reduced  
by the awesome wreckage induced by late stages of aged senile demen-
tia and probably by Alzheimer’s disease (there is no right way to be sure). 
He is at home, in bed, about thirty feet away from where he wrote Com-
mon Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts and his other writings. 

He deteriorates steadily. To those few of us taking care of him, it is 
startlingly quickly. By the time you read this, he may well be deceased. 
He will never read these words—were they read to him, he couldn’t fol- 
low their meaning for more than a sentence or two before losing the 
thread in dangling disconnects cut by his dread disease. He was a great 
man but is now just a little, old man very late in life. But he is my little, 
old  man. What  this  disease  routinely  does  to  people  is  nothing  to  be 
ashamed of; it is just a disease, not a failing.When I wrote my third book, 
based on one hundred cameo biographies of dead pioneers of American 
finance, I deﬁned it as “dead” pioneers only on the premise that dead 
people  don’t  sue,  just  in  case  I  got  anything  wrong.  But  I  also  did  so 
because I purposefully didn’t want to cover my father in any regard. I 
didn’t want to say anything that might hurt him if I interpreted him dif-
ferently than he might have wished, which I well might have.

Introduction

Now I need not worry about that because he won’t know what I 
say here. So it is time to tell you a bit about the man who wrote one of 
the best beloved investment books of all time. I’m best qualiﬁed to do 
so because I know him better than anyone if you combine business and 
personal matters. Oh, certainly, in other ways my mother, his wife, knew 
him far better than anyone. My aunt, his sister, knew him longer than 
anyone. But their relationships were basically personal, not business.Yes,  
I have an eldest brother who worked very closely with him brieﬂy and 
was  temporarily  my  business  partner  and  to  whom  I’m  close.  But 
Arthur’s  professional  time  span  around  Father  was  fairly  short.  He 
evolved to academic humanities, where he is today. Father always loved 
Arthur  foremost  of  his  three  sons,  and Arthur  was  more  emotionally 
linked to Father than I was. But Arthur would be ﬁrst to tell you I spent 
vastly more business time around Father over many more years and had 
a  day-to-day  relationship  with  him  when Arthur  couldn’t,  materially 
because Arthur lived a thousand miles away. 

BEGINNINGS

My paternal ancestors were Jewish, mainly from Prague, Czechoslovakia, 
and Germany, all arriving in San Francisco in the early 1850’s. My father’s 
paternal grandfather was Philip Isaac Fisher and was both Levi Strauss’s  
original accountant and the person who opened and closed Strauss’s ﬁrst 
store for him on a daily basis and served Strauss his entire career. My 
great-grandfather was not wealthy but at his death was ﬁnancially com-
fortable. His wife died young, and his eldest daughter, Caroline or Cary,  
donned  an  important  role  caring  for  her  siblings.  My  grandfather, 
Arthur Lawrence Fisher, the youngest of eight, adored Cary, who played 
partial  surrogate  mother.  Born  in  1875  in  San  Francisco,  Arthur 
Lawrence Fisher grew, graduated from UC-Berkeley, and attended Johns  
Hopkins  Medical  School,  graduating  in  1900  and  returning  to  San 
Francisco to practice medicine as a general practitioner. Later (perhaps 
in World War  I  but  maybe  earlier,  during  post-doctoral  scholarship- 
based  research  at  Rockefeller  University),  he  developed  a  specialty  in  
orthopedics,  becoming  the  third  orthopedic  surgeon  west  of  the 
Mississippi and a founding member of the Western Orthopedics Society. 
In 1906, Philip Isaac Fisher died, stalling brieﬂy Arthur Fisher’s marriage 
to  Eugenia  Samuels. The  marriage  stalled  again  behind  the  infamous 

Introduction

1906 ﬁre and earthquake. Finally they married, and my father was born 
the next year, on September 8, 1907. He was named originally Philip 
Isaac Fisher, after his recently deceased grandfather. 

Four years later in 1911, my father’s sister, his only sibling, was born. 
She was named Caroline after Aunt Cary. Aunt Cary had married well, 
to a Levi Strauss relative named Henry Sahlein, who was introduced to 
Cary through her father. Aunt Cary played an important role in the lives 
of Fishers for two generations, those of both my grandfather and father. 
Aunt  Cary  not  only  secretly  bankrolled  my  father’s  education  (some-
thing he never, ever knew), but also secretly gave my grandfather money 
to buy a car for Father that became serendipitously seminal to his career 
evolution.  And  Cary  provided  ongoing  family  social  structure  that 
enriched Father’s fragile emotional existence as a child—a process that 
continued for decades. If my parents had had a daughter, she would have 
been named Cary, as was their ﬁrst grandchild. 

Unlike  many  doctors,  my  paternal  grandfather  was  largely  unin-
terested  in  money.  He  did  a  great  deal  of  charity  work  and  academic 
medicine, but he didn’t care for business or money. When his private prac- 
tice patients couldn’t pay, he simply cared for them anyway. When he  
sent  out  bills  that  went  unpaid,  he  ignored  rebilling  or  collection 
attempts. He was thought of by myriad people as saintly for his kind, 
warm, and generous persona. Fortunately for his immediate family, he 
had Aunt Cary to “secretly” bankroll him behind the scenes. Without 
Cary, you likely would never have gotten this book. 

Father  was  originally  privately  tutored.  My  grandfather  didn’t 
believe in the elementary schools of the day, and Aunt Cary could afford 
better. Later, Father was enrolled in San Francisco’s prestigious Lowell 
High School. He graduated at age sixteen. Smart, too young, well edu-
cated from tutoring, Father was also awkward and lacking in social skills 
other children normally learn in elementary school. He was frail, brittle, 
and uncoordinated sports-wise; and being young by comparison, he was 
small relative to Lowell classmates. So he felt socially insecure, which was  
furthered  by  his  mother’s  incessantly  critical  and  negative  nature.  At 
sixteen,  Father  started  at  UC-Berkeley;  but  later,  with  ﬁnancial  aid 
from Aunt Cary and a car paid for by her, he transferred to smaller and 
friendlier Stanford University. That transfer also proved fateful. 

He dutifully returned to San Francisco on weekends, which began 
with  a  ritual  Friday  night  family  dinner  at  Aunt  Cary’s  and  Uncle 
Henry’s. These dinners spanned almost ﬁfty years, starting before Father’s 

 
4  

Introduction

birth, and included even distant family members.The dinners were cen-
tral to building Father’s early social skills. (The ritual still existed brieﬂy 
when I was a child.) My grandparents always attended. Father arrived 
directly from Berkeley or later Stanford. Cary’s house, which if it existed 
today would be called a mansion, was built in the 1890’s by Uncle Henry 
on  Jackson  Street,  just  off Van  Ness. The  multi-course  feast  involved 
much discourse and after-dinner debate that often turned various family 
participants combative, something my grandfather loved watching.There 
were lots of child-aged females; but as the only male of his generation, 
Father became a particular favorite of Uncle Henry, which made these 
events particularly memorable to father—his one chance as a young man 
to stand out in a crowd. After dinner, Father returned home with his 
par-ents, heading back to college Monday morning. 

To Father,Stanford was spectacular. Warm, beautiful, laid-back, presti-
gious, he felt more comfortable at Stanford than at Cal or pretty much any- 
where else. Upon graduating at twenty, and still insecure but feeling safe at 
Stanford, he remained in the then brand-new ﬁrst class of the Stanford 
Graduate School of Business, again secretly underwritten by Aunt Cary. 
Father never knew about Cary’s ﬁnancial largesse on his behalf. Multiple 
other family members knew. Cary and my grandfather believed it was bet- 
ter if the beneﬁciary of the largesse thought it came from a father who 
earned his savings rather than from a rich aunt who married money. 

Stanford  didn’t  then  have  an  investment  class  as  it  does  now;  but 
as  Father  has  described  in  other  writings,  there  was  then  a  class  that 
traveled  to  visit  and  analyze  local  businesses.  Father  had  a  car  and 
volunteered to drive the professor, Boris Emmett; so they spent a lot of 
time together, which had a profound effect on Father. He felt he learned 
more from those car rides with Emmett than from all of his other time  
at  Stanford  combined.  He  described  all  that  better  than  I  could  in 
his  1980  Financial  Analysts  Research  Foundation  (FAF)  monograph, 
“Developing an Investment Philosophy,” and so I won’t tread there. In 
his  original  preface  to  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon  Proﬁts,  he 
described his early business years, so I won’t tread that turf either. 

MIDDLE LIFE

As World War  II  evolved,  Father  put  his  business  interests  on  ice  and 
enlisted.Too old and too well educated for ideal cannon fodder, he got 

Introduction 

5 

lucky.  Long-time  mentor  Ed  Heller  enlisted  ahead  of  him  and  pulled 
some strings—somehow Father was made an instant ofﬁcer and hence 
never saw the front line. Instead, he fought the war from behind desks 
all over mid-America, doing accounting and ﬁnance for the Army Air 
Corps. On day one, he was a lieutenant, which he found awkward. On 
reporting  for  duty,  in  uniform,  lower-ranking  personnel  would  salute 
him,  yet  he  didn’t  know  how  to  respond.  Senior  personnel  expected 
respect  and  appropriate  behavior,  which  he  also  didn’t  know  how  to 
deliver. It took time to adjust. He hated the military, thought of it as a 
terrible time, despite admitting quite readily that he was treated well by 
it. He hated the regimentation, the lack of freedom, and being ordered 
about. When  stationed  in  Little  Rock, Arkansas,  he  met  my  mother, 
Dorothy Whyte, who was also in service there. My mother came from 
Camden, Arkansas, which is very close to where President Bill Clinton 
was later raised. Father ﬂipped head over heels for my mother instantly  
and  asked  her  to  marry  him  only  weeks  into  their  relationship;  she 
immediately  agreed.  In  1944  my  eldest  brother,  Arthur,  was  born— 
mother having been sent ahead to San Francisco to be with my grand-
father for his medical supervision prior to and after birth. She remained 
there until Father’s discharge, whereupon he returned home and renewed 
his business interests as described in his monograph. Donald was born in 
1947 and I in 1950. In between the birth of Donald and me, a daughter 
died in childbirth. 

Shortly after I was born, they bought a house on the site where they 
now live in San Mateo, California, twenty minutes south of San Francis-  
co. But they came to hate the house while loving the acre on which the 
house sat.They loved the views, the trees, and the landscape. Father ripped 
the house down and built the house in which I was raised and where he 
and my mother resided ever after. We rented a house a block away during 
construction.When complete, the house was big, all white, clean, and aus- 
tere. In my father’s house, everything must be neat to a fault. Possessions  
in all forms were sparse and exactly in their places or they drove him nuts. 
He loved the yard. Until very late in life, he spent almost a complete day  
each weekend in the bottom of the yard, which was almost wild but with 
spectacular oak trees and wildﬂowers. He would weed and tend to his 
wild-like garden and worry about all the things he fretted about, whether 
the stock market, politics, family matters, or whatever; and to him that 
time was a marvel, curative for everything annoying him. It was only as 
his dementia started, causing him to fall often, that he gave up the garden.

Introduction

The late 1950’s and the 1960’s were the high point of Father’s life, 
in  my  view.  In  1958,  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon  Proﬁts  was  pub- 
lished, making him an instant, national star. Locally, it made him sort of 
the dean of the San Francisco investment community. I doubt anyone 
had before received so much instant stature from an investment book. 
Certainly, tied to its era, Benjamin Graham’s Security Analysis took much 
longer  to  become  prominent.  Local  names  that  held  sway  in  1960 
included Dean Witter, who founded and headed that great and locally- 
based  brokerage  ﬁrm.  But  to  Dean Witter,  New York  was  the  mecca. 
And the public already fathomed that a broker was not a money man-
ager. The then famous Gerald Loeb, also of San Francisco Jewish origin 
and also a broker, may have been bigger nationally, but he had long gone  
on to New York and lost the local link. Simply put, in San Francisco by  
1960, there was no investment advisory name as noted as Father’s. Dif- 
ferent than today, all Northern California investing activities were geo- 
graphically centralized in a few blocks around Montgomery and Bush 
Streets in San Francisco. In that realm Father held prestige of which he 
could have only fantasized in his insecure childhood. 

There was a provision then in California state law, which still exists, 
allowing an advisor who maintained fewer than ﬁfteen clients and did 
not  hold  himself  out  to  the  public  as  an  investment  advisor  both  to 
avoid Securities and Exchange Commission registration and to main-
tain contracts for compensation for a percent of proﬁts that were oth-
erwise  made  illegal  in  1940,  a  point  most  investors  don’t  appreciate 
today.  Before  then,  scam  artists  would  seek  clients,  tell  half  to  do  one  
thing,  tell  the  other  half  to  do  the  reverse,  charge  20  percent  of  the 
proﬁt on whatever happened, and pick up 10 percent of the spread no 
matter what happened. Hence percentage-of-proﬁt contracts were illegal 
for all investment advisors for more than forty years unless the person 
had  fewer  than  ﬁfteen  clients  and  did  not  advertise  as  an  investment 
advisor. And it was in this way that Father structured his business on his 
return  from  military  service. With  the  fame  from  Common  Stocks  and 
Uncommon Proﬁts, he could easily maintain as clients a few very wealthy 
local families who paid him well and yet required no real organization 
to  support  him.  That  allowed  him  to  feel  superior  to  others  who 
required a more  public clientele and to remain  a very private person, 
which ﬁt well with his social awkwardness and insecurity. Despite his 
fame and notoriety, he always felt uncomfortable in the public spotlight 
and avoided it.

Flashback to 1945. Herbert Dougall was hired by Stanford and started 
the Graduate School of Business’s ﬁrst dedicated investment course. In  
all  of  history,  only  three  people  ever  taught  that  course.  Dougall 
taught it from 1946 to 1968, twenty-two years in all, except for a two-
year sabbatical in 1961 and 1962 when Father taught the course on a 
part-time, temporary basis. Among Father’s students was Jack McDonald, 
who was hired by Stanford in 1968 and who has taught the course ever 
since.When Dougall was away, it was largely on my father’s reputation 
deriving from Common Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts and from his alum-
nus status that caused him to be picked. Father loved it. It revived his 
youthful love affair with Stanford. Had Dougall not returned, I could 
envision my father doing that course, part time, forever. But Dougall did 
return,  and  Jack  McDonald  took  over  in  1968.  By  Jack’s  testimony,  it 
was  Father  who  got  him  interested  in  markets.  Before  that,  Jack  had 
been a young Hewlett-Packard engineer who changed the course of his 
life’s work at the junction when he met Father. Jack has since said that  
Father’s major contribution, as seen through Common Stocks and Uncommon 
Proﬁts, is to be the ﬁrst person to link the models of sustainable growth 
with the concept of competitive advantage.Today, that is a pretty standard 
package, but not then. In some ways Jack sees Father more as a seminal 
strategist than as a stock market innovator or operator. 

Anyway, for the many students and business folks who hold Stan-
ford in awe and respect its MBAs highly and who think those who took 
its graduate investment course advantaged, note: For a very long time, 
that  course  was  taught  either  by  the  author  of  the  book  you  hold  in 
your hand (for two years) or by his disciple,and by only one man before, 
ever. What  a  testament  to  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon  Proﬁts—one 
few readers appreciate or know. For a very long time, until after I came 
to temporarily own the book’s rights and then, subsequently, got into a 
dumb ﬁght with Jack McDonald (which was my fault), Jack always used 
Common Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts as a formal or informal Stanford 
textbook for the course. Over the years—not every year, but for many 
years—Father  drove  down  to  Stanford  at  Jack’s  request  to  deliver  an 
annual lecture and answer questions in Jack’s class. In May 2000, after 
many years of absence and with Father well into dementia, Jack asked 
him to return and lecture. I was scared to death Father would embarrass 
himself because I knew he wasn’t at all the man he used to be. But Father 
rose to the occasion and had one of his best days in a long time, deliver-
ing a rousing lecture and answering all questions from all comers. The

Introduction

whole thing, including Jack’s warm introduction of Father, was reprinted 
verbatim in volume XV, number 7, of the Outstanding Investor Digest. 

As Father’s dementia overtook him, he slowly lost more of the mem-
ories of past businesspeople he had known. For the most part, the earlier 
he knew them, the longer he remembered them, and the most recent 
acquaintances faded ﬁrst from memory. For example, he remem-bered 
many  people  from  the  1950’s,  whereas  he  had  forgotten  pretty  much 
everyone  he  had  known  from  the  1970’s.  Dementia  is  like  that.  But 
more emotional memories are embedded deeper in the mind; and Jack 
McDonald, whom Father met in 1961, thirty-three years into a seventy- 
two-year career, was one of the very last business personas to fade from 
his recollection, demonstrating how much McDonald meant to him. 

As  the  1960’s  passed,  Father  became  ever  less  interested  in  his 
pub-lic image and more interested in being quiet. He fancied himself 
a great judge of businesspeople and largely was, but he knew that was 
a private activity. He responded to few local requests for appearances 
but declined ever more of them, and he wouldn’t travel to appear in 
public ever again. In 1970, at sixty-three, he still didn’t have a gray 
hair on his head. That same year, my oldest brother, Arthur, an eccle-
siastical historian by training and a very good one, went to work to 
join him.Two years later, I joined. Father’s vision was that we would 
work  for  a  few  years  and  then  slowly  take  over  his  business. That 
could  never  happen.  It  took  me  only  about  a  year  to  realize  why. 
Father  was  such  a  stickler  for  detail  and  so  focused  and  so  socially 
awkward  and  insecure  that  he  was  absolutely  incapable  of  delegat-
ing in any way. So, Arthur and I could never really evolve into any 
meaningful  contributors.  I  was  inherently  high  energy,  rebellious, 
and  emotionally  pretty  brutal  to  people;  and  as  soon  as  I  real-ized 
Father  could  never  delegate,  I  knew  I  had  to  distance  myself  from  
him for both our sakes. Otherwise, there was no opportunity for me, 
and either he would hurt me or I would hurt him or both. It took Arthur 
four more years to leave, and initially he left to join me. But it is tough 
for an older brother to join his younger brother as a junior partner, and 
that wasn’t meant to be. So,Arthur left the industry and I remained, but 
separate, interacting but distanced from Father. These years were the 
ﬁrst real disappointments since Common Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts 
appeared. They included both the brutal 1973–1974 bear market and 
the beginning of Father’s body starting to slow a bit. In 1977, he was 
seventy; and while he would never admit it and while still exceptionally

energetic for a man that age, he wasn’t as buoyant as he had been and 
for the ﬁrst time began to show the early signs of aging. His hair was 
thinning  and  partially  gray  now.  In  the  afternoon  train  rides  down 
the  peninsula,  he  started  falling  asleep  regularly.  Sometimes  in  the 
after-noon,  he  fell  asleep  at  his  desk.  He  was  due,  but  he  couldn’t 
quit. 

During these years, he determined that he would improve the quality 
of his holdings by weeding out the weakest among the few he owned to 
own  even  fewer  of  higher  quality.  In  retrospect,  and  without  him 
fathom-  ing  it,  what  he  was  doing  was  cutting  down  the  universe 
requiring  his  attention  to  match  diminishing  energy.  Early  in  his 
career, he might have owned thirty stocks: a few big established ones, 
some  mid-sized  ones  he  had  bought  as  smaller  companies  and  still 
held and would for decades, some small ones for which he had high 
and  long  hopes,  and  a  handful  of  private-placement,  venture  cap–
type  holdings  in  tiny  amounts  that  he  thought  of  as  icing  rather 
than  cake.  In  the  mid-1970’s,  he  steadily  and  slowly  sold  the  ones 
he thought less of and concentrated on his favorite holdings, so that 
by  about  1990  he  held  six  stocks  and  by  2000  he  held  three.  None 
of  it  went  well.  My  advice  to  all  investors  is  to  stop  making  invest-
ment decisions of any kind when you get old, whatever “old” means  
to  you.  Stop  before  you  get  old.  I’ve  watched  great  investors  age, 
and  there  are  no  old,  great  investors. There  are  old  men  who  were 
great;  but  the  process  of  investing  is  too  vital  to  allow  for  old  age 
and  future  greatness  together,  and  aging  becomes  more  power-
ful  than  the  prior  greatness,  which  eventually  implodes  foolishly.
In  medicine, “aged  fragility”  is  a  great  frontier  as  a  future,  new  rec-
ognized,  disease  but  now  it  stops  all  old  great  investors. There  sim-
ply  are  no  great  octogenarian  investors.  In  his  later  years,  Father 
could  talk  well  and  think  well,  but  he  didn’t  have  the  clarity  
for 
timed, 
consistently.  Late  in  life,  he  would  say  things  like  he  was  looking 
for stocks he could hold for thirty years, which sounded silly for an 
eighty-ﬁve-year-old. People often thought it was charming, which was 
also pretty silly. I think a lot of other people knew he was doing this 
because he loved it and couldn’t quit, even if it wasn’t good for him 
ﬁnancially. But he was indulged by everyone, including me.What did I 
care? If it made him happy, it was ﬁne by me. But some could see that 
he was a bit like a man hanging around the ballpark with bat and glove

when too old to play. His few late-in-life purchases were not success-
ful. He would have been much better off ﬁnancially if he had just quit 
doing anything at the age of eighty or even seventy. It wouldn’t have 
mattered  if  he  sold  and  went  into  index  funds  or  just  held  what  he 
owned until he died. As it was,his decisions detracted value steadily. 

His  long-held  prescription  for  investors  had  been  to  buy  great 
com-panies and pretty much hold them forever. And he had owned 
great  companies.  Had  he  followed  his  own  prescription  late  in  life 
and  not  attempted  to  ﬁddle  and  ﬁx  past  his  prime,  he  could  have 
held  what  he  owned  until  death  and  done  far  better  than  he  did. 
I  don’t  recall  every-thing  he  ever  owned,  but  I  recall  the  main 
holdings.  In  1973,at  the  market’s  peak,  he  owned  among  then-big 
ﬁrms in big amounts Dow Chemical, FMC Corporation, Motorola, 
and  Texas  Instruments.  Among  medium-sized  companies  in  big 
amounts,  he  owned  Raychem  and  Reynolds  and  Reynolds.Those 
six  stocks  then  constituted  two-thirds  of  his  net  worth. The  big-
gest  positions  were  Motorola,  Texas  Instruments,  and  Raychem;  
and had he held them all until now, despite the ravaging of the 2000–2002 
bear market, he would have done very well. But with the exception of 
Motorola, they were all sold and the timing was terrible in every case, 
something he wouldn’t have done if he was younger. Among smaller 
ﬁrms, he owned many, all selected between 1968 and 1973—and few 
did well for him after 1973. The most spectacular by far was a ven- 
ture capital holding in Manufacturing Data Systems, which went pub- 
lic and then was acquired in the 1980’s and in which he made a hun-
dred times his money. The earliest of them, Rogers Corporation, he still  
owns. Motorola he still owns. Late in life, he tended to sell the ones that 
were long beat up, and often just before they came back to life with 
spectacular  bounces.  He  did  that  particularly  with  FMC  and Texas 
Instruments in the 1980’s and Raychem in the 1990’s. 

Also in the 1970’s something happened in his mind that I don’t 
understand. His father had practiced medicine until very shortly before 
he died in 1959. In just a few years, my grandfather got what today  
would probably be diagnosed as Alzheimer’s or some form of dementia. 
He quickly deteriorated, falling apart and then passing away. But Father’s  
analysis  was  different.  He  thought  his  father  fell  apart  because  he 
stopped working; and he concluded that if he stopped working, he, 
too, would fall apart and die. And so he concluded he had to drive 
himself  on.  For  the  rest  of  his  life,  work  was  life  itself.  Slowly,  he 

Introduction 

1 1 

resigned him-self to being able to do less, but he pushed himself to 
do as much as he could and did a remarkable job of it. He saw life 
as like a muscle—if you worked it hard, it kept working for you; but 
if you let it relax, it would weaken (and in his mind it would lead to 
decay and death). Even when, eventually, his dementia forced him to 
quit working completely, he resented it terribly and believed it would 
cause his death rather than seeing it the other way around—that his 
dementia  was  taking  him  down  whether  he  worked  or  not.  Even 
after  the  dementia  was  diagnosed,  he  kept  working,  with  monthly 
visits  to  the  neurologist  to  appraise  the  sta-tus  of  his  condition. 
In  1999,  with  dementia  impairing  but  not  stopping  him,  I  moved 
his  ofﬁce  into  his  home,  into  my  old  bedroom,  including  every-
thing  that  remained  in  his  former  ofﬁce.  He  told  his  few  remain-
ing clients about his condition and they remained with him; but he 
could hold back the failing-memory march for only about eighteen 
months longer. In 2000, he gave up completely. For the next year, he  
talked to me steadily, asking about writing another book, how to get 
back  into  business,  whether  he  could  travel  around  to  universities 
to  lecture  like  he  did  to  Stanford.  He  even  made  a  stab  at  writing 
another book, which he envisioned as What I’ve Learned in the Past 
Twenty-Five Years. But he only got seven pages actually dictated. The 
energy was draining from him almost monthly, and his mental capa-
bility steadily diminished. As the disease will do, he talked about plans 
one morning and forgot them by afternoon.When his career was over 
after seventy-two years, he initially became tremendously depressed 
because his self-image was so linked to his career functioning. As my 
deceased mother-in-law used to say, “Old age isn’t for sissies.” 

WHAT KIND OF MAN? 

Father was sparse, Spartan, serious with a weird sense of humor linked 
to plays on words. He loved puns and referred to anyone else’s pun as, 
“two-thirds of a pun, or PU!” When I was a child, my friends were all 
scared to death of him because he had an unintentional cold stare that 
pierced right through you. If you didn’t know him well, he scared you 
to  death—dark  hair,  dark  complexion,  not  big  (in  fact,  almost  gaunt),  
but  scary  looking,  and  often  dressed  in  dark  clothes.  Had  he  been 
twenty  years  younger  and  seventy-ﬁve  years  earlier,  he  would  have 

 
1 2  

Introduction

looked  a  bit  like  the  archetypal  image  of  the  thin,  dark-haired,  dark-
dressed, bad-guy gunslinger in westerns.You could fantasize him saying, 
“Just  one  move  and  I’ll  plug  you.”  But  he  didn’t “plug”  anyone.  He 
wasn’t mean. He just looked mean. He didn’t have to say a word. Still, 
children tip-toed around him and scooted fast to avoid him. Again, he 
wasn’t mean, but he wasn’t warm and fuzzy either; and he never, ever 
praised anyone except my oldest brother, whom he adored from birth.  
Fact  is,  I’ve  always  known  my  father  held  me  in  high  regard,  maybe 
higher  regard  than  almost  anyone  he  ever  interacted  with,  even  if  he 
displayed  it  in  strange  ways  and  often  not  at  all.  Often  not  at  all.  For 
example,  except  once  when  I  was  sixteen  that  I  recall  very,  very  dis-
tinctly,  he  never,  ever  praised  me  directly  about  anything  at  all  until  
I  was  well  into  my  forties.  It  bothered  me  when  I  was  young,  but  I 
came  to  accept  it. That  was  who  he  was.  He  just  wasn’t  the  praising 
kind. He would tell others how proud he was of me, almost bragging, 
and I’d hear it from them; but he could never tell me. He later told me 
he  regretted  that  but  hadn’t  known  how  to  deal  with  it. This  type  of 
communication was difﬁcult for my father. 

Let me help you put that in perspective by describing a part of his  
career.  Decades  before  a  world  of  computer  screening,  he  had  a 
methodology he employed for ﬁnding new ideas for new stocks. He let 
it be known that any young investment man could set an appointment 
to meet him just once and talk investments. Usually he would never see 
the man again. But if he thought the person unusually capable, he would 
see him repeatedly and offer to swap ideas over time. He let the other 
guy know what he was interested in and vice versa; and then over time 
if  they  saw  something  of  interest,  they  would  swap  ideas. These  folks 
passed on many ideas to father over the decades.Yet he was so clear in 
what  he  wanted,  relative  to  the  ﬁfteen  points,  and  so  focused  to  do  
nothing  else,  that  in  his  entire  career  he  essentially  only  followed  any 
one  man  into  a  stock  once.  Other  ideas  from  that  same  person  he 
brushed off because they were never quite good enough in his mind— 
not quite right. 

He followed the thinking of two particular individuals twice. One  
of  the  two  had  ideas  that  were  money  losers  both  times. The  only 
person he ever followed three times was me. He adopted three of my 
stock ideas fully across his client base and for him and my mother and 
made  more  than  a  thousand  percent  on  each  of  them. Those  were 
the  most  ideas  he  ever  adopted  from  any  one  person,  ever,  and  he 

Introduction 

1 3 

did well with all of them; mine all came in the mid-to-later-1970’s, 
late in his career, which, as I’ve already told you, was a time when 
his successes were thin-ning and should have been, therefore, doubly 
precious. 

But let me show you who he was. Of those three stock ideas, two 
he never acknowledged to me.The third? More than ﬁfteen years later, 
in my forties, he sent me a short note to tell me I had done well with 
it—he owned it still then and years later.When I recalled the other two 
ideas to him, he acknowledged them but no further. No congratulations. 
No thank you. Because I was always less fearful of him than others were, 
I verbally kicked at him a bit at times, which I did then, asking who else 
had he ever gotten three successful investment ideas from. He pointed 
out to me that there was no one, but that wasn’t so important.The key 
was in him, he explained, in knowing which ideas to follow and which 
to discard and that he hadn’t followed any of my bad ideas.That annoyed 
me. So, I retorted that he had followed plenty of other people’s bad ideas, 
and then he got mad at me and we didn’t speak for about a month.Then 
he forgot he was ever mad at me, and the subject never came up again. 
That  was  who  he  was:  cool,  cold,  hard,  tough,  disciplined,  non-social, 
never quitting, ever conﬁdent externally but internally often scared. And 
amazing. I know he respected me; but to the people he respected most, 
he had the hardest time communicating that directly. 

What  was  his  daily  grind  like?  In  1958,  as  Common  Stocks  and 
Uncommon Proﬁts was published, Father arrived home from work in the 
late afternoon, changed clothes, ate dinner with the family formally in 
the  dining  room,  and  then  retired  to  the  living  room,  where  he  read, 
sometimes  business  materials  but  usually  library  murder  mysteries— 
until bedtime.When I was a child, he would take a break at our bed-
time to tell my brothers and me bedtime stories, which he lavished on  
us—more  on  me  than  on  my  brothers  because  I  liked  them  better. 
Sometimes they were non-ﬁction history about heroic ﬁgures or events, 
like Joan of Arc, the American Revolution, Paul Revere’s ride, the life  
of  Napoleon.  Others  were  ﬁction  of  his  own  creation,  something  he 
hoped eventually to turn into children’s books but never did. They were 
all great. My brothers and I had separate bedrooms, and Father would  
sit on the bed’s edge of whomever he was telling the story to. One or 
more of us would lie on the ﬂoor nearby, and when we fell asleep, he 
carried us to bed. He and mother went to bed about ten. In the morning, 
he drove us kids to school at 7:30 in a beat-up old blue Oldsmobile and 

 
1 4  

Introduction

drove on to a point a half mile from San Mateo’s train station. He walked 
to the station and rode the rails into San Francisco. Early-morning San 
Mateo retailers came to call him “the ﬂash” because he walked so fast, 
leaning forward in a world long before “power walking.” He believed 
that if rain wasn’t hard, it did no good, and that if walking wasn’t fast, it 
was a waste of mileage. He loved the railroad train and had been riding 
trains since childhood. His morning train departed at 8:00. It arrived at 
the San Francisco depot at Third and Townsend Streets at 8:30 (a block 
from its current location). On the train he read business materials, every  
day.  If  someone  approached  him  to  talk,  he  told  them  he  was  busy 
working, which he was, and then kept reading. Cool. Solitary. He then 
walked a mile to his ofﬁce in Mills Tower at the corner of Bush and San- 
some  Streets.  If  someone  wanted  to  walk  with  him,  they  couldn’t  
because he walked so fast that they couldn’t keep up. Cool. Solitary. A 
sort of gunslinger of his own creation. At Mills Tower, he took the ele- 
vator to the eighteenth ﬂoor and entered his ofﬁce. Alone. Actually, he 
had two ofﬁces over the years. He was at suite 1810 from World War II  
until  1970,  when  he  moved  to  suite  1820. The  pictures  on  the  back 
cover of the dust jacket of Conservative Investors Sleep Well were in both 
ofﬁces, and they sit today on the wall of a conference room at my cor-
porate headquarters. 

His furniture never changed all those years. Same desk, which now 
sits in my old childhood bedroom. Chairs, and every form of appoint-
ment—none of it changed for forty years and was all Spartan. He was 
Spartan.  His  luxury  there? The  view  of  San  Francisco  Bay. When  he 
moved to 1820, he got the corner suite with bay views in two direc-
tions, high luxury. In the 1950’s, Mills Tower was one of the city’s two 
tallest ofﬁce buildings, along with the Russ Building. When he moved 
in 1970 to suite 1820, the view to the bay out both windows in both 
directions  was  clear.  By  the  mid-1980’s  when  I  moved  him  out,  he 
could see nothing but the taller ofﬁce buildings across the street in any 
direction at all. Tied to the San Francisco ofﬁce building boom of the  
1970’s,  the  city  just  grew  up  around  him—and  with  the  lack  of  bay 
view, much of his passion for being there faded. 

Each night, he walked the mile back to the train station and read 
more on the way home, although late in his life, as said earlier, he fell 
asleep a lot on the train in the afternoon. He was in the ofﬁce at 9:00 and 
left at 4:00 to return home. When it rained, he took the bus and hated it. 
The bus put him in close contact with all kinds of street people—after 

Introduction 

1 5 

all,anyone can get on the bus—and even with the best of folks (and he 
wasn’t a people person), he felt uncomfortable there. Compared to most 
business  successes,  he  never  worked  very  long  hours  or  all  that  hard  
or  frantically.  Early  on,  I  marveled  at  how  someone  could  have 
succeeded as well as he did working as few hours as he did or with as 
little stren-uous effort as he exerted; but it was because of his genius. At 
times, he was like a laser beam and beautiful to behold. You only need a 
relative few of those times in a career to accomplish a great deal if you 
don’t screw up too badly at other times. He had the one and not the 
other, and that made it work. 

And he was always alone. Until my brother went to work with 
him in 1970, he never had more than a part-time secretary around 
him, several half-days a week. For decades, up until the early 1970’s 
(which  also  marked  the  beginning  of  his  business  decline),  it  was 
one  woman,  Mrs.  Del  Poso. As  a  young  man,  I  never  got  to  know 
her  in  any  real  way  at  all,  which  I  now  regret  because  I’m  sure  I 
could have learned lots about Father from her. Otherwise he was sol-
itary. Non-social. Thinking. Reading. Talking on the phone, yes, but 
not oriented toward being with people. A very deﬁnite non-people  
person. 

Father loved to watch election returns. Always. A passion. He had a  
marvelous  memory  before  dementia.  Routinely,  he  memorized  the 
names  of  all  435  members  of  the  House  of  Representatives  and  the 
100 senators. To put himself to sleep at night, he would go state by state 
through their names until he drifted off. He also memorized each state 
capital and made me do it as a kid. To him, reciting them wasn’t chal- 
lenging because they never changed. But congressmen did, which gave 
him  new  grist. The  only  time  this  ever  really  backﬁred  on  him  was 
when Warren Buffett ﬁrst started interacting with him. Because he had 
Buffett’s father’s name stuck in his head from Howard Buffett’s days as  
Omaha’s  congressman,  Father  kept  referring  to  Warren  Buffett  as 
“Howard,” which came to periodically embarrass him when he caught 
it. Warren  never  called  it  to  his  attention.  I  pointed  it  out  to  Father 
several times, and he told me to mind my own business. But he loved 
watching  election  returns  because  it  was  the  beginning  of  the  next 
memorization cycle. It also linked to his interest  in analyzing politics, 
something that always fascinated him. And he wasn’t bad at it. He started 
with an advantage. Because he had all these guys names already memo-
rized so well, he was a leg up on most folks. I’ll bet at any one time there

aren’t 500 people in all of the United States who know all the names of 
all members of the House and the Senate. But he did. Always. 

Also, because he knew the names, it was easier for him than for most 
folk, as elections approached, to learn and to memorize which were the 
races  that  were  close  and  could  go  either  way.  Long  before  folks  like 
political analyst Charles Cook reﬁned his analytical structure, Father had 
the  races  categorized  into  groups  by  region  as  to  safe  seats  for  either 
party,  semi-safe  seats,  and  seats  that  were  competitive  to  toss-ups.  On 
election night, he would hone in on those relatively few seats that were 
the  closest  races  and  likely  to  go  either  way. As  returns  came  in,  he 
loved staying up late at night collecting data and writing them down and 
re-calibrating what that meant to the balance of power in Congress in  
the next two years and how that might effect the president and U.S. politics 
in general. He was not very good at knowing what would cause those 
close races to likely go one way or the other, nor did he think he was; 
but he knew which ones were close and watched them like a hawk. Just 
because I knew he wasn’t good at knowing what would cause them to 
break one way or the other, I later put effort into getting speciﬁcally- 
trained to do just that—because I wanted to learn something I knew he 
didn’t know how to do. Late in his life, he marveled that I could do it 
because it was inconceivable to him that anyone could. But it is a pret- 
ty simple set of skills. The irony is that if earlier in his career someone 
had taught him how to do it, he could readily have done it quite well 
and, I’m sure, far better than I could. But another feature of his life was 
that  any  technique  he  didn’t  learn  before  age  ﬁfty,  he  probably  never 
learned. He had a lot going on by that age, which is just when Common 
Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts appeared.

The book’s publication tied into other personal qualities that were 
weird. Note his dedication in Common Stocks and Uncommon Proﬁts. It 
says, “This  book  is  dedicated  to  all  investors,  large  and  small,  who  do 
NOT adhere to the philosophy:‘I have already made up my mind, don’t 
confuse  me  with  facts.’  ” As  long  as  I  knew  him,  in  any  area  outside 
investing,  he  didn’t  want  to  be  confused  with  facts  because  he  didn’t 
want his life disrupted because he was a creature of habit, almost above 
and beyond all things. Everything had to stay just as it was.You couldn’t 
replace anything with a new-and-improved version.That he tore down 
his house and re-built it was miraculous. He just didn’t want facts if they 
might lead him to change. It impacted everything from his garden to his 
cars,  clothes,  furniture,  acquaintances;  whatever  it  was,  he  didn’t  want

change.When I worked for him brieﬂy, I didn’t really know him well at 
ﬁrst in a business sense, but I could see that his ofﬁce was antiquated. So 
I set out to do minor improvements. 

In 1972, he still had a battery of three rotary-dial telephones on his 
desk, and he was hard of hearing. So, he would be talking on one and 
another would ring and he would have no idea which one it was; and  
he would regularly pick up the wrong one and slam it back down hur- 
rying  to  the  other.  I  installed  a  standard  single-set,  touch-tone  phone 
with multiple lines and ﬂashing lights. It took him months to get over 
being mad at me. I interfered with his world, and he could not accept 
it as an improvement. But he learned the business point of it, and for 
business he would change; and he ﬁnally got used to it—it became a 
new habit and he forgot he was ever mad at me. But when I was four-
teen and used money I’d saved from working part-time jobs to buy him 
a jacket to wear in the woods with me on a family trip, he would never 
wear it, preferring to wear, believe it or not, an old sport coat he had 
owned forever. He hated change. 

He had an old hand-crank adding machine in his ofﬁce that was 
probably  ﬁrst  operated  by  Tyrannosaurus  rex. When  I  ﬁrst  saw  him 
pounding on that darned thing, I thought his desk would implode or  
his wrist would shatter. Three feet from where I sit now, I have a col- 
lection of memorabilia. One item, from his ofﬁce, was an October 20,  
1961,  Wall  Street  Journal  announcement  of  what  was  the  ﬁrst  four- 
function calculator. It wasn’t called that at the time. It was called a 
pocket computer, and it used integrated circuits ( Jack Kilby of Texas 
Instruments co-invented the integrated circuit in the 1950’s for which 
he later won a Nobel prize), which were then called,“solid circuit semi- 
conductor networks.”  The calculators were for the space program and  
weighed ten ounces and cost $29,350 each. My father had been one of  
Texas  Instruments’  earliest  public  investors  as  described  in  his 
FAF  monograph;  and  by  the  time  I  arrived,  he  was  very  devoted 
to  Texas  Instruments.  So,  in  1973,  I  got  him  a  very  early  com-
mercial  electronic  calculator  and  junked  his  aged  hand-cranker. 
I  thought  he  would  like  it  because  it  was  from Texas  Instruments 
and  was  so  vastly  superior  to  his  adding  machine  and  because  he 
could  do  all  kinds  of  things  not  before  possible.  But  he  didn’t  like 
it  one  bit  because  it  involved  change;  and  it  took  him  most  of  a 
year to get over being annoyed at that habit change. Still, he ﬁnally 
got  used  to  it,  and  then  it  was  as  if  he  had  always  owned  it.  He 

 
1 8  

Introduction

sold  his  Texas  Instruments  stock  in  the  1980’s  but  continued  to 
use old and antiquated Texas Instruments calculators the rest of his  
career because he hated changing. 

By Father’s admission, he had just ﬁve friends in his whole life— 
David Samuels (his younger ﬁrst cousin), Ed Heller, Frank Sloss, Louis 
Lengfeld, and John Herschfelder—and they from fairly early on and all 
but  one  family  connected.  Despite  all  these  friends  being  local,  as  a 
mature adult, he rarely saw them. Father knew David Samuels all his life 
and  telephoned  him  regularly  but  only  saw  him,  maybe,  twice  a  year. 
Mentioned earlier, Ed Heller was a half generation older and successful  
and  wealthy  before  my  father’s  time  and  became  a  major  mentor 
early  on.They  met  when  Ed  married  a  cousin.  Heller  was  a  suc-
cessful stock market investor, an overall businessman, and a venture 
capitalist  and  may  have  been  the  man  Father  admired  most  until 
the  early  1950’s.  Heller  died  soon  thereafter.  Frank  Sloss  shared  a 
room  with  Father  at  Stanford,  and  they  remained  close  ever  after 
and, hereto, Frank married a cousin and Father and Frank remained 
close  until  Frank  died  in  the  1980’s.  Frank  was  what  today  we 
call  an  estate  planning  attorney  in  San  Francisco  and  did  most  of 
Father’s  non-securities  legal  work  until  Frank  died;  and  in  that 
way  they  spoke  often.  But  they  saw  little  of  each  other  other-
wise.  Louis  Lengfeld  was  himself  a  distant  relative  and  a  client  of  
father for many years, and they often commuted together into San 
Francisco. I saw him far more often than the others because he lived 
close by and picked father up to commute together on the train. Louis 
died in the 1950’s; his son allegedly refused to pay the ﬁnal bill, and 
Father sued him and won. Cool. Tough. Pretty darned solitary. And the 
son? He is now dead himself. Father’s longest lasting friend? John Her-
schfelder, an engineer, who had been close to Father since childhood. 
But he only saw or spoke to Johnny maybe once every four years as an 
adult. Father couldn’t stand the guy’s wife—drove him crazy. Still, when  
Johnny was in the hospital, dying, Father made regular trips there to sit 
with him. Johnny was important to Father. Yet in life, he couldn’t ﬁnd 
ways to be with the man, because Father was solitary. Stoic. Alone,  
except with my mother. He just didn’t like people very much. Most 
people like to be around friends, just to be with them and bask in 
their companionship, sort of glowing. He didn’t. 

He liked to be alone or with my mother; and pretty much of the 
time when he was with my mother, they were both alone, she in the 

Introduction

family den and he in the living room. It was just who he was. But he 
was  beyond  anxious  if  he  was  separated  from  her  when  he  wasn’t  at 
work or in the garden. Other people? He just didn’t like being around 
other people much. He liked me, but if I was around him too much, it 
bugged him. Or Arthur, and he liked Arthur better than anyone but my 
mother.  But  the  reality  is  that  Father  was  just  a  solitary  guy.  Regard-
less of with whom he interacted, it was all relative degrees of solitude. 
When Arthur and then I came to work with him in the early 1970’s, it  
drove  him  nuts,  in  my  opinion.  He  had  been  pretty  much  alone  and 
solitary  his  whole  career,  and  being  around  us  all  that  time  was  too  
much. Seeing that it drove him nuts, realizing I hadn’t yet really learned 
who he was and, as stated earlier, realizing there wasn’t a career oppor- 
tunity  with  him  because  he  couldn’t  delegate,  I  determined  rather 
promptly to distance myself a bit to make him and me less nuts. I quit  
his  employment  and  started  out  on  my  own  within  a  year.  But  I 
remained in the same building. I had an unusual ability to not be both-
ered much by Father’s weirdness and to separate from him but remain  
fairly close. Arthur couldn’t do that. Too much emotion. Arthur isn’t as  
emotionally  tough  as  I  am,  never  was;  I  don’t  know  why.  I  always  
thought both my brothers took Father much too seriously and, ultimately, 
couldn’t  take  him  nearly  as  much  or  as  well  as  I  could.  Ultimately 
Father’s emotion took too big a toll on Arthur, and he left the industry 
completely  in  1977  and  moved  to  Seattle  and  on  to  academics.  My 
father was simply not a man to be close to people. 

He  was  pretty  frugal  sometimes;  and  when  I  was  young  and  we 
went somewhere on business, I had to share a hotel room with him.We 
did  this  even  after  I  could  afford  my  own  room  because  he  couldn’t 
handle the notion of me “wasting” the money. When I was about thirty,  
I just couldn’t do it any more. But one night in the early 1970’s, we were 
together in Monterey at one of the ﬁrst elaborate dog-and-pony shows 
for technology stocks—then known as “The Monterey Conference”— 
put on by the American Electronics Association. At the Monterey Con- 
ference, Father exhibited another quality I never forgot. The conference 
announced a dinner contest. There was a card at each place setting, and 
each person was to write down what he or she thought the Dow Jones 
Industrials would do the next day, which is, of course, a silly exercise. 
The cards were collected. The person who came closest to the Dow’s 
change for the day would win a mini–color TV (which were hot new 
items  then). The  winner  would  be  announced  at  lunch  the  next  day, 

 
2 0  

Introduction

right after the market closed at one o’clock (Paciﬁc time). Most folks, it 
turned out, did what I did—wrote down some small number, like down 
or up 5.57 points. I did that assuming that the market was unlikely to 
do anything particularly spectacular because most days it doesn’t. Now 
in those days, the Dow was at about 900, so 5 points was neither huge 
nor tiny. That night, back at the hotel room, I asked Father what he put 
down; and he said, “Up 30 points,” which would be more than 3 per-
cent. I asked why. He said he had no idea at all what the market would 
do; and if you knew him, you knew that he never had a view of what 
the market would do on a given day. But he said that if he put down a 
number like I did and won, people would think he was just lucky—that 
winning at 5.57 meant beating out the guy that put down 5.5 or the 
other guy at 6.0. It would all be transparently seen as sheer luck. But if 
he won saying,“Up 30 points,” people would think he knew something 
and was not just lucky. If he lost, which was probable and he expected  
to,  no  one  would  know  what  number  he  had  written  down,  and  it 
would cost him nothing. Sure enough, the next day, the Dow was up 26 
points, and father won by 10 points. 

When it was announced at lunch that Phil Fisher had won and how 
high  his  number  was,  there  were  discernable “Ooh”  and “Ahhhh” 
sounds all over the few-hundred-person crowd. There was, of course,  
the news of the day, which attempted to explain the move; and for the 
rest of that conference, Father readily explained to people a rationale for 
why he had ﬁgured out all that news in advance, which was pure ﬁction,  
and  why  the  market  had  done  what  it  did,  again  pure  ﬁction  and 
nothing  but  false  showmanship.  But  I  listened  pretty  carefully,  and 
everyone  he  told  all  that  to  swallowed  it  hook,  line,  and  sinker.
Although  he  was  socially  ill  at  ease  always,  and  insecure,  I  learned 
that day that my father was a much better showman than I had ever 
fathomed. And, oh, he didn’t want the mini-TV because he had no 
use at all for change in his personal life. So he gave it to me and I 
took it home and gave it to mother, and she used it for a very long 
time. 

THE THREE W’s 

What  else  did  my  father  enjoy? Three  big W’s:  walking,  worrying, 
and work. He loved them all. I never really saw him relax in the ways 

Introduction 

2 1 

most folks do, I think because he loved to worry so much. Under-
neath his surface was a sort of endless undulating nervous energy that 
he liked to channel into worrying. He could worry about anything. 
It made him feel safe in some way. It was as if he somehow believed if 
he worried enough, he would have covered all the risks and nothing 
bad could hap-pen to him. He would worry about the same things 
over  and  over  and  over.  Because  he  always  worried  so  much  and 
because I was always a rebel, I never much worried. That bugged him. 
I have always been prone to simply thinking things through as thor-
oughly as I can once and then going with my decision. If I conclude 
I’m wrong, I may conclude to change. That drove him nuts. Father 
used  to  say  to  me,“Ken,  I  wish  you  would  run  scared  more  often. 
How about just once? I just wish you would run scared.” He prided 
himself on “running scared.” For the life of me, I couldn’t think why 
I would want to live life that way; but he not only wanted that for 
me, he wanted it for himself. 

In the garden, my father could sit and worry about all the things he 
cared about, and that made him feel better. It may well have contributed 
to why he made fewer investment mistakes than most investors do. He 
worried everything over until he had worried it to death. Maybe he had 
reduced risk that way. But that also may well have contributed to why  
he wasn’t richer than he was. He wasn’t willing to take risks on things  
for which he hadn’t worried the mistakes down to marginality. In that 
way, he was never a big risk taker, and those who get really rich take 
bigger calculated risks than he was ever willing to take. 

And walking? When Father was on a walk, his body  was purging 
that excess undulating energy, and he was the most relaxed I ever saw 
him. He could take a long walk, in either the city or the woods, and  
calm down. He could talk while he was walking and be calm about it. 
He  started  every  workday  walking  to  and  from  the  train  station  and 
ended his day that way, too. And if he wasn’t walking fast, it didn’t count. 
When Arthur and I used to take the train and walk into town with him 
and  back,  we  would  be  sweaty  and  uncomfortable  and  resentful.  He  
never  sweated.  He  was  one  who  liked  it  hot.  But  that  was  when  he  
could say what was on his mind in ways he never could without walking. 
After I moved his ofﬁce to San Mateo late in his career, he walked from 
home and back, and he said it was the most peaceful time he had ever 
known  as  an  adult,  walking  through  San  Mateo’s  residential  gardens, 
gazing at the bright ﬂowers. He was a great walker, simply great. The 

 
2 2  

Introduction

man’s body was staggering. Tough. He could walk forever on legs that 
wouldn’t quit no matter what, no matter how far or how steep the hill. 
He loved it. 

I  live  and  work  on  top  of  a  two-thousand-foot-tall  redwood- 
covered mountain overlooking the Paciﬁc Ocean. I have lived there 
thirty years, and I have two hundred of my ﬁve hundred people up 
there  at  headquarters. And  I  own  a  stunning  mountain-top  ranch 
property nearby that is the only in-holding inside a ﬁve-thousand-
acre open-space preserve. Once when father was eighty, he and my 
twelve-year-old son, Nathan, and I left the rest of the extended fam-
ily at the ranch and started downhill, toward the Paciﬁc, through the 
trees on the trails into the heart of Purisima Canyon. Father whistled 
and talked as if he were a boy. No worries. Walking. Walking purged 
worry. I’ve been a moun-tain man in this area most of my life and 
know it exceptionally well, and my legs are used to hills from living 
here. At  every  trail  junction,  I  would  say, “Now  Father,  this  way  is 
the shorter, less steep, quicker way to get back, and that way is the 
longer, further-down-in-the-canyon, steeper way. Which way do you 
want to take?” At every junction, he chose the harder, longer way. We 
dropped thirteen hundred feet in elevation and walked ﬁve miles, at 
which point we had to get back up. I was a bit worried. When we 
stopped, Father wasn’t walking, so he would start to worry. And he 
could worry about nothing at all and turn it into a big worry. And 
right then he worried that my mother would be wor-ried that we 
were stranded and hurt in the woods because it was taking us so long 
to get back. Nathan, raised on the mountain, scampered ahead like 
a  darting  deer. As  the  sun  started  setting,  Father  fretted  more  and 
wanted us to pick up the pace. Of course, my mother wasn’t worried. 
She wasn’t the worrying kind. That’s what he liked—walking, wor-
rying, and work. 

One of the best times I ever had with my father came about by 
serendipity. I was fourteen. The family—Mother, Father, Donald, and 
I—were  having  a Wyoming-dude-ranch  summer  vacation.  Arthur 
was gone from home by then. Father and I had been hiking daily. I 
was a nut about wildlife at that time— loved critters of all forms. One 
day we were out hiking and looking for antelope. Father was walking 
and talking. I was looking for antelope.We were way the heck away 
from  the  car,  maybe  four  miles,  in  the  high  plateau,  sparse  chapar-
ral.  Summer  clouds  started  to  ﬁll  the  sky,  and  we  started  drifting 

Introduction 

2 3 

back  toward  the  car.  Quickly  the  clouds  turned  deadly  dark.  Out 
of  nowhere,  it  cooled,  and  lightening  and  hail  pounded  all  around 
us—huge  golf-ball-sized  hail  stones  hitting  us. We  ran  for  the  car. 
Lightening  was  striking  everywhere.We  should  have  ﬂattened  our-
selves to the ground; but I was young and stupid and he didn’t know  
any better, and we kept running. Lightening strikes hit the ground ten 
and twenty-ﬁve feet from us over and over, and we were terriﬁed. The 
hail was hitting my father on the top of his head, and he was holding  
his  head  and  running.  I  was  ﬁfteen  and  reasonably  athletic. 
He  was  ﬁfty-  nine  and  could  keep  up  with  me  running  without 
much  problem  because  he  had  those  legs  that  wouldn’t  quit. We 
ﬁnally made it to the car and piled into it. The lightening continued 
all around, but we were ﬁnally safe—and I never saw my father laugh 
so hard. He had run so hard that he didn’t worry for an hour. 

In the early 1980’s, Father had some bad experiences walking from 
the San Francisco depot to his ofﬁce and back, including not watching 
where he was going and bonking his head on a metal post once, pass-
ing out once, and getting accosted by a wanna-be mugger once. And,  
so, mother and I convinced him to follow my lead by letting me move 
his ofﬁce down the peninsula, something I had done in 1977. I moved 
him and set up his ofﬁce in San Mateo in a little ofﬁce building on Fifth 
and El Camino Real. He continued to walk from home to work every 
day  and  loved  it.  Gardens.  No  muggers.  Few  stop  lights  or  crazy  taxi 
drivers to dodge. Beautiful ﬂowers. No worries. 

As mentioned earlier, late in his life, my father started falling down 
in his garden on Sundays. It was an early warning of dementia’s onset, 
but no one saw it as such at the time. In retrospect, I can see that there 
were other signs of it back then. But I knew nothing about demen- 
tia  and  couldn’t  recognize  them.  His  father  probably  had  Alzhei-
mer’s,  too,  but  there  was  no  such  name  for  it  back  then. The  early 
progression of the disease is often very hard to detect and impossi-
ble  if  you  don’t  know  what  to  look  for,  which  none  of  us  around 
Father did. And if we had, the tough old coot wouldn’t have listened 
to us anyway because he was always ruggedly independent and self-
willed. 

One of his former Stanford students,Tony Spare, who went on to 
run the Bank of California’s money management operations and then 
started  his  own  successful  money  management  ﬁrm  (since  sold  and  a 
shadow of its former self ), long revered Father. On November 5, 1998, 

 
2 4  

Introduction

Tony was having a client seminar in San Francisco and asked Father to 
come deliver a dinner speech. Father left his San Mateo ofﬁce in the late 
afternoon to walk to the train station to ride to the city, where he could 
catch a taxi downtown to Tony’s event.Tony would drive him home that 
night. The  walk  was  wet  from  the  afternoon’s  light  drizzle. As  Father 
passed through downtown San Mateo, he saw the next stop light start-
ing to shift from green to yellow and he ran to beat it, something he had 
done all his life. As he ran off the near curb, he slipped and fell, break-
ing his right hip cleanly. The recovery went reasonably well, but from  
moment  one  of  that  trauma,  dementia  flooded  through  the  oppor- 
tunity like a dam breaking. 

As Father’s body recovered, his memory and logic did less so. I 
was running his health care program and feeling pretty darned good 
about how well he was improving. But as so often happens with a hip 
break in the elderly, on January 15, 1999, he contracted pneumonia, 
which  hit  him  hard  and  almost  killed  him.  By  January  19,  he  was 
in intensive care, and we were told to expect his death by morning. 
Mother was very upset. Arthur ﬂew down from Seattle and sat the 
night with him. By 3 
, the tough old coot was pulling through, 
coming  out  of  the  coma  and  reacting  initially  to  pin  pricks  to  his 
, Arthur had me back down there. By 8, I was calling 
toes. By 5 
mother, who was already grieving his death, telling her to get back 
down to meet me because she could once again talk with her hus-
band, who was conscious and clear-eyed, even if he was still on a res-
pirator. I assembled an around-the-clock ded-icated team of nurses 
and injected them into the hospital with my own doctor’s oversight 
to supervise Father as he came out of intensive care. Hospitals do the 
best they can with elderly patients, but their care for people in that 
condition is really totally inadequate; and there isn’t much they can do 
about it because of how they function. And the family was clear that 
we were going to do better. This particular hospital had never before 
actually had anyone bring in a dedicated outside crew, but they were 
very good to me as I put it in place, allowing us much more free-
dom than I expected or deserved. It turned out that father needed it.  
He  was  nip  and  tuck  with  death  twice  more  before  ﬁnally  pull-
ing through, including requiring on very short notice an emergency 
proce-dure  that  drained  a  quart  and  a  half  of  ﬂuid  from  his  lung 
by  needle  injunction  and  vacuum  removal. The  ﬂuid  had  ﬁlled  his 
lungs almost instantly.Without our dedicated crew to catch it fast, he 

Introduction 

2 5 

would  not  have  survived.  But  all  this  trauma  beat  up  his  body  and 
mind. 

The  entire  crisis,  which  included  several  small  strokes,  was  still 
another ﬂoodgate for the dementia to pour through en masse. Still, this 
old man’s tough body recovered enough to where he could walk several  
miles  a  day  and  talk  clearly  at  length,  even  if  he  couldn’t  remember 
many  things.  By  then,  however,  he  had  forgotten  pretty  much  every-
thing after about 1968. Slowly, as dementia does, his long-term memo-
ries became only about older and older events. He is at the stage now 
where he recalls very  little  and  recognizes  very few people, typical of  
late dementia. The slide was a slow, irregular decline that felt amazingly 
swift to all of us as it occurred every few months. The only people he 
always knows now are my mother and me. It shocked me when he ﬁrst 
failed to recognize Arthur, his favorite son, whom he now sometimes 
knows and sometimes doesn’t. He remembers me because he sees me  
more  often  and  long  has. At  home,  with  around-the-clock  in-home  
help,  he  is  bedridden,  unable  to  walk,  lacking  his  favorite  activities  of  
most of his life—the walking, the worrying, and the third “W,” work- 
ing.  I  take  care  of  pretty  much  everything  in  terms  of  health  care, 
ﬁnances, and so on for both him and my mother. While my mother is  
still  pretty  vital,  my  father  isn’t  the  man  I  knew.  Not  at  all. The  man  
I knew is long gone. 

Today my mother puts in endless time on him but struggles under 
the burden. Despite his health care providers doing an overall great job 
for him, she never feels it is good enough and regularly injects herself 
into the middle, which ultimately drains her to exhaustion. Then, with 
her away, he starts calling out for her, and it is very tough on her and on 
everyone. I can’t tell how much of a curse and how much of a blessing  
it will be for her when he ﬁnally passes on. It is impossible to tell.The 
only thing I know for sure is that old age isn’t for sissies. 

They had eleven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. The 
ﬁrst  grandchild  was  named  after  my  aunt  who  was  named  after Aunt 
Cary. The second was named after my father, Philip A. Fisher. They are 
the only real name-sakes. My father always regretted that none of his 
grandchildren were named after Mother, but she didn’t care. It wouldn’t 
be like her to fret over something like that. Because Father had his own 
children fairly late in life, he was really closest to his oldest grandchildren. 
Mother, being the baby of her family, was more naturally drawn to her 
younger grandchildren.Two of the great-grandchildren my parents barely 

 
2 6

know. The other two they have never met, all residing far, far away. Only a  
few of the grandchildren have any real sense of the man I knew. They 
never saw the mirror. 

SIGNIFICANCE—THE MIRROR IMAGE 

My father is a great man who inﬂuenced many people, great and small, 
from  national  business  leaders  to  students  to  students  of  his  students 
who went into other ﬁelds. He had a knack for getting people to see 
things they wouldn’t see otherwise, not by telling them but by some-
how getting them to think thoughts they don’t believe they ever would 
have thought without interaction with him.At times,it was like he was  
a mirror held up to your brain. 

I can’t tell you how many people over the decades said something 
to me like, “I met him once.It was only brieﬂy, but he said x, y, and z,  
and that made me think, and that gave me the idea I used in starting 
my company.” It was, of course, their idea, but they somehow credited 
him with some of its creation. He brought that quality out in people. 
Somehow he made people think things that they might have thought 
anyway, but for sure they believed they thought them because of inter- 
actions  with  Father.  I  remember  some  of  these  people  clearly,  and  to  
my  certain  knowledge  Father  didn’t  say  the  things  that  some  people 
thought he said. But somehow they heard the right words anyway, and 
that is all that counts for them. His writings are like that, too, and always 
have  been  for  many  people.  Many  investors  have  told  me  over  the  
decades  how  they  did  this  or  that  because  of  something  they  read  in 
Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon  Proﬁts  or  in  Conservative  Investors  Sleep 
Well.  Of  course,  they  didn’t. They  did  whatever  they  did  because  of 
something in them, in their mind. But they believe it was inspired by 
something they read in those books. The books are good. The inspira- 
tions are even better. 

And that is a very good thing. If you read my father’s writings and 
ideas come to you, ones he never really said, and if you are motivated  
by  them,  so  much  the  better.  It  is  another  reason  that  re-reading  his 
books  is  useful.  Somehow,  my  father  was  a  mirror  for  many  people: 
He  let  them  see  themselves  in  ways  they  believe  they  wouldn’t  have  
otherwise.  Now,  forty-ﬁve  years  after  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon 
Proﬁts ﬁrst appeared, my father will never directly have that impact on

anyone  again.  But  his  writings  carry  on.  If  you’ve  never  read  him, 
I hope you enjoy this man. If you’ve read him before, I welcome you 
back. With  the  response  his  writings  have  received  over  these  forty- 
five  years,  it  is  quite  clear  they  will  be  here  for  you  for  the  remain- 
der  of  your  life  and  probably  far,  far  after,  just  as  his  memory  will  be 
for me.

Preface

The publication of a new book in the ﬁeld of investment may well 

require some explanatory statement from its author. The following 
remarks  will  therefore  have  to  be  somewhat  personal  in  order  to 
supply an adequate explanation for my venturing to offer another book 
on this subject to the investing public. 

After  one  year  in  Stanford  University’s  then  brand-new  Graduate 
School of Business Administration, I entered the business world in May 
1928. I went to work for, and twenty months later was made the head 
of, the statistical department of one of the main constituent units of the 
present Crocker-Anglo National Bank of San Francisco. Under today’s 
nomenclature I would have been called a security analyst. 

Here I had a ringside seat at the incredible ﬁnancial orgy that cul- 
minated in the autumn of 1929 as well as the period of adversity that 
followed. My observations led me to believe that there was a magniﬁ- 
cent opportunity on the West Coast for a specialized investment coun- 
seling ﬁrm that would make itself the direct antithesis of that ancient 
but  uncomplimentary  description  of  certain  stockbrokers—men  who 
know the price of everything and the value of nothing. 

On March ﬁrst 1931, I started Fisher & Co. which, at that time, was 
an investment counseling business serving the general public but with 
its interests centered largely around a few growth companies.This activ-
ity prospered.Then came World War II. For three and a half years, while 
I was engaged in various desk jobs for the Army Air Force, I spent part 
of such spare time as I had in reviewing both the successful and, more 
particularly,  the  unsuccessful  investment  actions  that  I  had  taken  and  

3 1

3 2  

that  I  had  seen  others  take  during  the  preceding  ten  years.  I  began 
seeing  certain  investment  principles  emerge  from  this  review  which 
were  different  from  some  of  those  commonly  accepted  as  gospel  in 
the ﬁnancial community. 

When  I  returned  to  civilian  life  I  decided  to  put  these  principles 
into practice in a business atmosphere as little disturbed by side issues as 
possible.  Instead  of  serving  the  general  public,  Fisher  &  Co.  for  over 
eleven  years  has  never  served  more  than  a  dozen  clients  at  one  time. 
Most of these clients have remained the same during this period. Instead 
of being mainly interested in major capital appreciation, all Fisher & Co. 
activity has been focused upon this one objective. I am aware that these 
past eleven years have been a period of generally rising stock prices dur-
ing  which  anyone  engaged  in  such  activities  should  have  made  good 
proﬁts.  Nevertheless  by  the  degree  to  which  these  funds  have  consis- 
tently forged ahead of the generally recognized indices of the market as 
a  whole,  I  ﬁnd  that  following  these  principles  has  justiﬁed  itself  even 
more  thoroughly  in  the  postwar  period  than  was  the  case  in  the  ten 
prewar  years  when  I  was  only  partially  applying  them.  Perhaps  even 
more signiﬁcant, they have been no less rewarding during those of these 
years when the general market was static or declining than when it was 
sharply advancing. 

In studying the investment record both  of myself and others,  two 
matters were signiﬁcant inﬂuences in causing this book to be written. 
One, which I mention several times elsewhere, is the need for patience 
if big proﬁts are to be made from investment. Put another way, it is often 
easier to tell what will happen to the price of a stock than how much 
time will elapse before it happens.The other is the inherently deceptive 
nature of the stock market. Doing what everybody else is doing at the 
moment, and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do, 
is often the wrong thing to do at all. 

For these reasons over the years I have found myself explaining in 
great detail to the owners of the funds I manage the principles behind 
one or another action I have taken. Only in this way would they have 
enough  understanding  of  why  I  was  acquiring  some,  to  them,  totally 
unknown security so that there would be no impulse to dispose of it 
before  enough  time  had  elapsed  for  the  purchase  to  begin  justifying 
itself in market quotations. 

Gradually  the  desire  arose  to  compile  these  investment  principles 
and have a printed record to which I could point. This resulted in the 

Preface 

3 3 

ﬁrst groping toward organizing this book.Then I began thinking of the 
many  people,  most  of  them  owners  of  far  smaller  funds  than  those 
belonging to the handful of individuals it is my business to serve, who 
have come to me over the years and asked how they as small investors 
could get started off on the right path. 

I thought of the difﬁculties of the army of small investors who have 
unintentionally picked up all sorts of ideas and investment notions that 
can prove expensive over a period of years, possibly because they had 
never  been  exposed  to  the  challenge  of  more  fundamental  concepts. 
Finally I thought of the many discussions I have had with another group 
also vitally interested in these matters, although from a different stand-
point. These are the corporate presidents, ﬁnancial vice presidents and 
treasurers of publicly owned companies, many of whom show a deep 
interest in learning as much as possible about these matters. 

I concluded there was need for a book of this sort. I decided such 
a book would have an informal presentation in which I would try to 
address you, the reader, in the ﬁrst person. I would use much the same 
language  and  many  of  the  same  examples  and  analogies  that  I  have  
employed  in  presenting  the  same  concepts  to  those  whose  funds  I 
manage.  I  hope  my  frankness,  at  times  my  bluntness,  will  not  cause 
offense.  I  particularly  hope  that  you  will  conclude  the  merit  of  the  
ideas I present may outweigh my defects as a writer.

Clues from the Past

You have some money in the bank.You decide you would like to 

buy  some  common  stock. You  may  have  reached  this  decision 
because you desire to have more income than you would if you 
used these funds in other ways. You may have reached it because you 
want to grow with America. Possibly you think of earlier years when 
Henry Ford was starting the Ford Motor Company or Andrew Mellon 
was building up the Aluminum Company of America, and you wonder 
if you could not discover some young enterprise which might today lay 
the groundwork for a great fortune for you, too. Just as likely you are 
more afraid than hopeful and want to have a nest egg against a rainy day.
Consequently, after hearing more and more about inﬂation, you desire 
something which will be safe and yet protected from further shrinkage  
in the buying power of the dollar.

Probably  your  real  motives  are  a  mixture  of  a  number  of  these 
things,  inﬂuenced  somewhat  by  knowing  a  neighbor  who  has  made 
some money in the market and, possibly, by receiving a pamphlet in the 
mail explaining just why Midwestern Pumpernickel is now a bargain.A 
single  basic  motive  lies  behind  all  this,  however.  For  one  reason  or 
another, through one method or another, you buy common stocks in 
order to make money. 

Therefore, it seems logical that before even thinking of buying any 
common stock the ﬁrst step is to see how money has been most suc- 
cessfully made in the past. Even a casual glance at American stock mar-
ket history will show that two very different methods have been used to 
amass spectacular fortunes. In the nineteenth century and in the early 

3 4

1Clues from the PastClues from the Past 

3 5 

part of the twentieth century, a number of big fortunes and many small 
ones  were  made  largely  by  betting  on  the  business  cycle.  In  a  period 
when an unstable banking system caused recurring boom and bust, buy- 
ing stocks in bad times and selling them in good had strong elements of 
value. This was particularly true for those with good ﬁnancial connec- 
tions who might have some advance information about when the bank-
ing system was becoming a bit strained. 

But perhaps the most signiﬁcant fact to be realized is that even in 
the stock market era which started to end with the coming of the Fed- 
eral Reserve System in 1913 and became history with the passage of the 
securities  and  exchange  legislation  in  the  early  days  of  the  Roosevelt 
administration,  those  who  used  a  different  method  made  far  more 
money  and  took  far  less  risk.  Even  in  those  earlier  times,  ﬁnding  the 
really  outstanding  companies  and  staying  with  them  through  all  the 
ﬂuctuations of a gyrating market proved far more proﬁtable to far more 
people than did the more colorful practice of trying to buy them cheap 
and sell them dear. 

If this statement appears surprising, further ampliﬁcation of it may 
prove even more so. It may also provide the key to open the ﬁrst door  
to  successful  investing.  Listed  on  the  various  stock  exchanges  of  the 
nation  today  are  not  just  a  few,  but  scores  of  companies  in  which  it 
would  have  been  possible  to  invest,  say,  $10,000  somewhere  between 
twenty-ﬁve and ﬁfty years ago and today have this purchase represent 
anywhere from $250,000 to several times this amount. In other words, 
within the lifetime of most investors and within the period in which 
their parents could have acted for nearly all of them, there were avail-
able scores of opportunities to lay the groundwork for substantial for-
tunes for oneself or one’s children. These opportunities did not require 
purchasing on a particular day at the bottom of a great panic. The shares 
of these companies were available year after year at prices that were to 
make this kind of proﬁt possible. What was required was the ability to 
distinguish these relatively few companies with outstanding investment 
possibilities from the much greater number whose future would vary all 
the way from the moderately successful to the complete failure. 

Are there opportunities existing today to make investments that in 
the years ahead will yield corresponding percentage gains? The answer  
to this question deserves rather detailed attention. If it be in the afﬁrma- 
tive, the path for making real proﬁts through common stock investment 
starts to become clear. Fortunately, there is strong evidence indicating 

 
3 6  

that the opportunities of today are not only as good as those of the ﬁrst 
quarter of this century but are actually much better. 

One reason for this is the change that has occurred during this peri- 
od in the fundamental concept of corporate management and the cor- 
responding changes in handling corporate affairs that this has brought 
about. A generation ago, heads of a large corporation were usually mem-
bers of the owning family. They regarded the corporation as a personal 
possession. The interests of outside stockholders were largely ignored. If 
any consideration at all was given to the problem of management con- 
tinuity—that is, of training younger men to step into the shoes of those 
whose age might make them no longer available—the motive was large- 
ly that of taking care of a son or a nephew who would inherit the job. 
Providing the best available talent to protect the average stockholder’s 
investment was seldom a matter in the forefront of the minds of man- 
agement. In that age of autocratic personal domination, the tendency of 
aging  management  was  to  resist  innovation  or  improvement  and  fre-
quently to refuse even to listen to suggestions or criticism. This is a far  
cry  from  today’s  constant  competitive  search  to  ﬁnd  ways  of  doing  
things better. Today’s top corporate management is usually engaged in 
continuous self-analysis and, in a never-ending search for improvement, 
frequently even goes outside its own organization by consulting all sorts 
of experts in its effort to get good advice. 

In former days there was always great danger that the most attrac-
tive corporation of the moment would not continue to stay ahead in its 
ﬁeld or, if it did, that the insiders would grab all the beneﬁts for them-
selves. Today, investment dangers like these, while not entirely a thing of 
the past, are much less likely to prove a hazard for the careful investor. 

One facet of the change that has come over corporate management 
is worthy of attention.This is the growth of the corporate research and  
engineering laboratory—an occurrence that would hardly have beneﬁt- 
ed the stockholder if it had not been accompanied by corporate man- 
agement’s learning a parallel technique whereby this research could be 
made a tool to open up a golden harvest of ever-growing proﬁts to the 
stockholder. Even today, many investors seem but slightly aware of how 
fast this development has come, how much further it is almost certain- 
ly going, and its impact on basic investment policy. 

Actually, even by the late 1920’s, only a half dozen or so industrial 
corporations had signiﬁcant research organizations. By today’s standards, 
their size was small. It was not until the fear of Adolf Hitler accelerated 

Clues from the Past 

3 7 

this type of activity for military purposes that industrial research really 
started to grow. 

It has been growing ever since. A survey made in the spring of 1956, 
published in Business Week and a number of other McGraw-Hill trade 
publications, indicated that in 1953 private corporate expenditures for 
research  and  development  were  about  $3.7  billion.  By  1956  they  had 
grown to $5.5 billion and present corporate planning called for this to 
be running at the rate of better than $6.3 billion by 1959. Equally star-
tling, this survey indicated that by 1959, or in just three years, a number 
of our leading industries expect to get from 15 per cent to more than  
20 per cent of their total sales from products which were not in com- 
mercial existence in 1956. 

In the spring of 1957 the same source made a similar survey. If the 
totals revealed in 1956 were startling in their signiﬁcance, those revealed 
just  one  year  later  might  be  termed  explosive.  Research  expenditures 
were up 20 per cent from the previous year’s total to $7.3 billion! This 
represents almost a 100 per cent growth in four years. It means the actu- 
al growth in twelve months was $1 billion more than only a year before 
had been expected as the total growth that would occur in the ensuing  
thirty-six  months.  Meanwhile,  anticipated  research  expenditures  in  
1960  were  estimated  at  $9  billion!  Furthermore,  all  manufacturing 
industries, rather than just a few selected industries as represented in the 
earlier survey, expected that 10 per cent of 1960 sales would be from 
products not yet in commercial existence only three years before. For cer- 
tain selected industries, this percentage—from which sales representing 
merely new model and style changes had been excluded—was several 
times higher. 

The impact of this sort of thing on investment can hardly be over-
stated.The cost of this type of research is becoming so great that the cor- 
poration which fails to handle it wisely from a commercial standpoint 
may stagger under a crushing burden of operating expense. Furthermore, 
there  is  no  quick  and  easy  yardstick  for  either  management  or  the 
investor to measure the proﬁtability of research. Just as even the ablest 
professional baseball player cannot expect to get a hit much more often 
than one out of every three times he comes to bat, so a sizable number 
of research projects, governed merely by the law of averages, are bound 
to  produce  nothing  proﬁtable  at  all.  Furthermore,  by  pure  chance,  an 
abnormal  number  of  such  unproﬁtable  projects  may  happen  to  be 
bunched together in one particular span of time in even the best-run 

 
3 8  

commercial laboratory. Finally, it is apt to take from seven to eleven years 
from the time a project is ﬁrst conceived until it has a signiﬁcant favor-
able effect on corporate earnings. Therefore,even the most proﬁtable of 
research projects is pretty sure to be a ﬁnancial drain before it eventual- 
ly adds to the stockholder’s proﬁt. 

But if the cost of poorly organized research is both high and hard 
to detect, the cost of too little research may be even higher. During the 
next  few  years,  the  introduction  of  many  kinds  of  new  materials  and 
new types of machinery will steadily narrow the market for thousands 
of companies, possibly entire industries, which fail to keep pace with the 
times. So will such major changes in basic ways of doing things as will  
be brought about by the adoption of electronic computers for the keep-
ing of records and the use of irradiation for industrial processing. How-
ever, other companies will be alert to the trends and will maneuver to 
make enormous sales gains from such awareness. The managements of 
certain of such companies may continue to maintain the highest stan-
dards of efﬁciency in handling their day-to-day operations while using 
equally good judgment in keeping ahead of the ﬁeld on these matters 
affecting the long-range future. Their fortunate stockholders, rather than 
the proverbial meek, may well inherit the earth. 

In addition to these inﬂuences of the changed outlook in corporate 
management  and  the  rise  of  research,  there  is  a  third  factor  likewise 
tending to give today’s investor greater opportunities than those exist-
ing in most past periods. Later in this book—in those sections dealing 
with  when  stocks  should  be  bought  and  sold—it  would  seem  more 
appropriate to discuss what, if any, inﬂuence the business cycle should 
have on investment policies. But discussion of one segment of this sub-
ject seems called for at this point.This is the greater advantage in own-
ing certain types of common stocks, as a result of a basic policy change 
that  has  occurred  within  the  framework  of  our  federal  government, 
largely since 1932. 

Both prior to and since that date, regardless of how little they had to 
do with bringing it about, both major parties took and usually received 
credit  for  any  prosperity  that  might  occur  when  they  were  in  power. 
Similarly, they were usually blamed by both the opposition and the gen-
eral public if a bad slump occurred. However, prior to 1932 there would 
have  been  serious  question  from  the  responsible  leadership  of  either 
party as to whether there was any moral justiﬁcation or even political 
wisdom in deliberately running a huge deﬁcit in order to buttress ailing 

Clues from the Past 

3 9 

segments of business. Fighting unemployment by methods far more cost- 
ly than the opening of bread lines and soup kitchens would not have 
been given serious consideration, regardless of which party might have 
been in ofﬁce. 

Since 1932 all that is reversed. The Democrats may or may not be 
less  concerned  with  a  balanced  federal  budget  than  the  Republicans.  
However,  from  President  Eisenhower  on  down,  with  the  possible 
exception of former Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey, the responsi- 
ble  Republican  leadership  has  said  again  and  again  that  if  business 
should really turn down they would not hesitate to lower taxes or make 
whatever other deﬁcit-producing moves were necessary to restore pros- 
perity and eliminate unemployment. This is a far cry from the doctrines 
that prevailed prior to the big depression. 

Even if this change in policy had not become generally accepted, 
certain other changes have occurred that would produce much the same 
results, though possibly not so quickly.The income tax only became legal 
during the Wilson administration. It was not a major inﬂuence on the 
economy until the 1930’s. In earlier years, much of the federal revenue 
came from customs duties and similar excise sources. These ﬂuctuated 
moderately with the level of prosperity but as a whole were fairly stable. 
Today, in contrast, about 80 per cent of the federal revenue comes from 
corporate and personal income taxes.This means that any sharp decline 
in the general level of business causes a corresponding decline in federal 
revenue. 

Meanwhile, various devices such as farm price supports and unem- 
ployment compensation have become imbedded in our laws. At just the 
time that a business decline would be greatly reducing the federal gov- 
ernment’s income, expenditures in these ﬁelds made mandatory by leg- 
islation would cause governmental expenses to mount sharply. Add to 
this the deﬁnite intention of reversing any unfavorable business trend by 
cutting taxes, building more public works, and lending money to vari-
ous hard-pressed business groups, and it becomes increasingly plain that 
if a real depression were to occur the federal deﬁcit could easily run at 
a rate of $25 to $30 billion per annum. Deﬁcits of this type would pro-
duce further inﬂation in much the same way that the deﬁcits resulting  
from  wartime  expenditures  produced  the  major  price  spirals  of  the 
postwar period. 

This means that when a depression does occur it is apt to be shorter 
than some of the great depressions of the past. It is almost bound to be 

 
4 0  

followed by enough further inﬂation to produce the type of general price  
rise that in the past has helped certain industries and hurt others.With this 
general economic background, the menace of the business cycle may well 
be as great as it ever was for the stockholder in the ﬁnancially weak or 
marginal company. But to the stockholder in the growth company with 
sufﬁcient ﬁnancial strength or borrowing ability to withstand a year or 
two of hard times, a business decline under today’s economic conditions 
represents far more a temporary shrinking of the market value of his hold- 
ings than the basic threat to the very existence of the investment itself that 
had to be reckoned with prior to 1932. 

Another  basic  ﬁnancial  trend  has  resulted  from  this  built-in  inﬂa- 
tionary bias having become imbedded so deeply in both our laws and 
our  accepted  concepts  of  the  economic  duties  of  government.  Bonds 
have become undesirable investments for the strictly long-term holdings 
of the average individual investor.The rise in interest rates that had been 
going on for several years gained major momentum in the fall of 1956. 
With  high-grade  bonds  subsequently  selling  at  the  lowest  prices  in 
twenty-ﬁve years, many voices in the ﬁnancial community were raised 
to  advocate  switching  from  stocks  which  were  selling  at  historically 
high levels into such ﬁxed-income securities.The abnormally high yield 
of bonds over dividend return on stocks—in relation to the ratio that 
normally  prevails—would  appear  to  have  given  strong  support  to  the 
soundness of this policy. For the short term, such a policy sooner or later 
may prove proﬁtable. As such, it might have great appeal for those mak-
ing short- or medium-term investments—that is, for “traders” with the 
acuteness and sense of timing to judge when to make the necessary buy- 
ing  and  selling  moves. This  is  because  the  coming  of  any  signiﬁcant 
business recession is almost certain to cause an easing of money rates and 
a corresponding rise in bond prices at a time when equity quotations 
are hardly likely to be buoyant.This leads us to the conclusion that high-
grade bonds may be good for the speculator and bad for the long-term 
investor. This  seems  to  run  directly  counter  to  all  normally  accepted 
thinking on this subject. However, any understanding of the inﬂuences 
of inﬂation will show why this is likely to be the case. 

In  its  letter  of  December  1956,  the  First  National  City  Bank  of 
New York  furnished  a  table  showing  the  worldwide  nature  of  the 
depreciation  in  the  purchasing  power  of  money  that  occurred  in  the 
ten years from 1946 to 1956. Sixteen of the major nations of the free 
world  were  included  in  this  table.  In  every  one  of  them  the  value  of 

Clues from the Past

money signiﬁcantly declined. These declines ranged from a minimum  
in Switzerland, where at the end of the ten-year period money would 
buy  85  per  cent  of  what  could  be  purchased  ten  years  before,  to  the 
other  extreme  in  Chile,  where  in  ten  years  it  had  lost  95  per  cent  of 
its former value. In the United States this decline amounted to 29 per  
cent  and  in  Canada  to  35  per  cent. This  means  that  in  the  United 
States the annual rate of monetary depreciation during the period was 
3.4 per cent, and in Canada it was 4.2 per cent. In contrast, the yield 
offered by United States Government bonds bought at the beginning 
of  the  period,  which  admittedly  was  one  of  rather  low  interest  rates,  
was  only  2.19  per  cent. This  means  that  the  holder  of  this  type  of 
high-grade,  ﬁxed-income  security  actually  received  negative  interest 
(or  loss)  of  better  than  1  per  cent  per  annum  if  the  real  value  of  his 
money is considered. 

Suppose, however, that instead of acquiring bonds at the rather low 
rates that prevailed at the beginning of this period, the investor could 
have  bought  them  at  the  rather  high  interest  rates  that  prevailed  ten  
years later. The First National City Bank of New York in the same arti-
cle also supplied ﬁgures on this matter. At the end of the period covered 
in the article, they estimated the return on United States Government 
bonds at 3.27 per cent, which still would leave no return whatever, actu- 
ally a slight loss, on the investment. However, six months after this arti-
cle was written, interest rates had risen sharply, and were above 3.5 per 
cent.  How  would  the  investor  actually  have  fared  if  he  had  had  the 
opportunity at the beginning of this period to invest with the highest 
returns that have prevailed in over a quarter of a century? In the great 
majority of cases he would still have gotten no real return on his invest- 
ment.  In  many  instances  he  would  have  had  an  actual  loss. This  is 
because nearly all such bond purchasers would have had to pay at least  
a 20 per cent income tax on the interest received before the genuine  
rate  of  their  return  on  the  investment  could  have  been  calculated.  In 
many  cases  the  bondholder’s  tax  would  have  been  at  a  considerably 
higher rate, since only the ﬁrst $2000 to $4000 of taxable income qual-
iﬁes at this 20 per cent level. Similarly, if an investor had purchased tax-
free municipal bonds at this all-time high, the somewhat lower interest 
rate that these tax-free securities carry would again not have provided 
any real return on his investment. 

Of  course,  these  ﬁgures  are  only  conclusive  for  this  one  ten-year 
period. They do indicate, however, that these conditions are worldwide 

 
4 2  

and therefore not too likely to be reversed by political trends in any one 
country. What is really important concerning the attractiveness of bonds 
as long-term investments is whether a similar trend can be expected in 
the period ahead. It seems to me that if this whole inﬂation mechanism 
is studied carefully it becomes clear that major inﬂationary spurts arise 
out of wholesale expansions of credit, which in turn result from large 
government deﬁcits greatly enlarging the monetary base of the credit 
system. The huge deﬁcit incurred in winning World War II laid such a 
base. The result was that prewar bondholders who have maintained their 
positions in ﬁxed-income securities have lost over half the real value of 
their investments. 

As already explained, our laws, and more importantly our accepted 
beliefs of what should be done in a depression, make one of two courses 
seem inevitable. Either business will remain good, in which event out- 
standing  stocks  will  continue  to  out-perform  bonds,  or  a  signiﬁcant 
recession  will  occur.  If  this  happens,  bonds  should  temporarily  out- 
perform the best stocks, but a train of major deﬁcit-producing actions 
will then be triggered that will cause another major decline in the true 
purchasing power of bond-type investments. It is almost certain that a 
depression will produce further major inﬂation; the extreme difﬁculty 
of determining when in such a disturbing period bonds should be sold 
makes me believe that securities of this type are, in our complex economy, 
primarily suited either to banks, insurance companies and other institu- 
tions that have dollar obligations to offset against them, or to individu- 
als with short-term objectives. They do not provide for sufﬁcient gain  
to the long-term investor to offset this probability of further deprecia- 
tion in purchasing power. 

Before going further, it might be well to summarize brieﬂy the var-
ious investment clues that can be gleaned from a study of the past and 
from a comparison of the major differences, from an investment stand-
point, between the past and the present. Such a study indicates that the 
greatest investment reward comes to those who by good luck or good 
sense ﬁnd the occasional company that over the years can grow in sales 
and proﬁts far more than industry as a whole. It further shows that when 
we believe we have found such a company we had better stick with it  
for a long period of time. It gives us a strong hint that such companies 
need not necessarily be young and small. Instead, regardless of size, what 
really counts is a management having both a determination to attain fur-
ther important growth and an ability to bring its plans to completion.

Clues from the Past 

4 3 

The past gives us a further clue that this growth is often associated with 
knowing how to organize research in the various ﬁelds of the natural sci- 
ences  so  as  to  bring  to  market  economically  worthwhile  and  usually 
interrelated product lines. It makes clear to us that a general characteris- 
tic of such companies is a management that does not let its preoccupa- 
tion with long-range planning prevent it from exerting constant vigi- 
lance  in  performing  the  day-to-day  tasks  of  ordinary  business 
outstandingly well. Finally, it furnishes considerable assurance that in spite  
of the very many spectacular investment opportunities that existed twenty- 
ﬁve or ﬁfty years ago, there are probably even more such opportunities 
available today. 

 
2

What “Scuttlebutt”  
Can Do

As a general description of what to look for, all this may be helpful. 

But  as  a  practical  guide  for  ﬁnding  outstanding  investments,  it 
obviously contributes relatively little. Granted that this furnishes a 
broad outline of the type of investment that should be sought, how does 
the investor go about ﬁnding the speciﬁc company which might open 
the way to major appreciation? 

One way that immediately suggests itself is logical but rather imprac- 
tical. This is to ﬁnd someone who is sufﬁciently skilled in the various facets 
of management to examine each subdivision of a company’s organization 
and by detailed investigation of its executive personnel, its production, its  
sales organization, its research, and each of its other major functions, form 
a worthwhile conclusion as to whether the particular company has out- 
standing potentialities for growth and development. 

Such a method may appear sensible. Unfortunately there are sever- 
al reasons why it usually will not serve the average investor very well. In 
the ﬁrst place, there are only a few individuals who have the necessary 
degree of top management skill to do a job of this kind. Most of them 
are busy at top-level and high-paying management jobs.They have nei- 
ther the time nor the inclination to occupy themselves in this way. Fur- 
thermore,  if  they  were  so  inclined,  it  is  doubtful  if  many  of  the  real 
growth  companies  of  the  nation  would  allow  someone  outside  their 
own organization to have all the data necessary to make an informed 
decision. Some of the knowledge gained in this way would be too valu-
able to existing or potential competition to permit its being passed on 
to anyone having no responsibility to the company furnishing the data. 

4 4

What “Scuttlebutt” Can Do  

4 5 

Fortunately, there is another course which the investor can pursue. 
If properly handled, this method will provide the clues that are needed 
to ﬁnd really outstanding investments. For lack of a better term, I shall 
call this way of proceeding the “scuttlebutt” method. 

As this method is spelled out in detail in the pages that follow, the 
average investor will have one predominant reaction. This is that regard-
less of how beneﬁcial this “scuttlebutt” method may be to someone else, 
it is not going to be helpful to him, because he just won’t have much 
chance to apply it. I am aware that most investors are not in a position 
to do for themselves much of what is needed to get the most from their 
investment funds. Nevertheless I think they should thoroughly under-
stand just what is needed and why. Only in this way are they in a posi-
tion to select the type of professional advisor who can best help them. 
Only in this way can they adequately evaluate the work of that advisor. 
Furthermore,  when  they  understand  not  only  what  can  be  accom-
plished, but also how it can be accomplished, they may be surprised at 
how from time to time they may be in a position to enrich and make 
more proﬁtable the worthwhile work already being done for them by 
their investment advisors. 

The business “grapevine” is a remarkable thing. It is amazing what  
an  accurate  picture  of  the  relative  points  of  strength  and  weakness  of 
each  company  in  an  industry  can  be  obtained  from  a  representative 
cross-section of the opinions of those who in one way or another are 
concerned  with  any  particular  company.  Most  people,  particularly  if 
they feel sure there is no danger of their being quoted, like to talk about 
the ﬁeld of work in which they are engaged and will talk rather freely 
about their competitors. Go to ﬁve companies in an industry, ask each 
of them intelligent questions about the points of strength and weakness 
of the other four, and nine times out of ten a surprisingly detailed and 
accurate picture of all ﬁve will emerge. 

However,  competitors  are  only  one  and  not  necessarily  the  best 
source of informed opinion. It is equally astonishing how much can be 
learned from both vendors and customers about the real nature of the 
people  with  whom  they  deal.  Research  scientists  in  universities,  in 
government, and in competitive companies are another fertile source of 
worthwhile data. So are executives of trade associations. 

In the case of trade association executives especially, but to a great 
extent the other groups as well, it is impossible to lay too much stress 
on the importance of two matters. The inquiring investor must be able 

 
4 6  

to  make  clear  beyond  any  doubt  that  his  source  of  information  will 
never be revealed.Then he must scrupulously live up to this policy. Oth- 
erwise, the danger of getting an informant into trouble is obviously so 
great that unfavorable opinions just do not get passed along. 

There is still one further group which can be of immense help to 
the  prospective  investor  in  search  of  a  bonanza  company. This  group, 
however, can be harmful rather than helpful if the investor does not use 
good judgment and does not do plenty of cross-checking with others 
to verify his own judgment as to the reliability of what is told him. This 
group consists of former employees. Such people frequently have a real  
inside view in regard to their former employer’s strengths and weaknesses. 
Equally important, they will usually talk freely about them. But enough 
such  former  employees  may,  rightly  or  wrongly,  feel  they  were  ﬁred 
without  good  cause  or  left  because  of  a  justiﬁed  grievance  that  it  is 
always important to check carefully into why employees left the com-
pany being studied. Only then is it possible to determine the degree of 
prejudice that may exist and to allow for it in considering what the for-
mer employee has to say. 

If enough different sources of information are sought about a com-
pany, there is no reason to believe that each bit of data obtained should 
agree with each other bit of data. Actually, there is not the slightest need 
for this to happen. In the case of really outstanding companies, the pre- 
ponderant information is so crystal clear that even a moderately experi-
enced investor who knows what he is seeking will be able to tell which 
companies are likely to be of enough interest to him to warrant taking 
the next step in his investigation.This next step is to contact the ofﬁcers 
of the company to try and ﬁll out some of the gaps still existing in the 
investor’s picture of the situation being studied. 

3

What to Buy

The Fifteen Points to Look for in a Common Stock

What are these matters about which the investor should learn if he 

is to obtain the type of investment which in a few years might 
show him a gain of several hundred per cent, or over a longer 
period of time might show a correspondingly greater increase? In other 
words,  what  attributes  should  a  company  have  to  give  it  the  greatest 
likelihood of attaining this kind of results for its shareholders? 

There are ﬁfteen points with which I believe the investor should con- 
cern himself. A company could well be an investment bonanza if it failed 
fully to qualify on a very few of them. I do not think it could come up to 
my deﬁnition of a worthwhile investment if it failed to qualify on many.  
Some of these points are matters of company policy; others deal with how 
efﬁciently this policy is carried out. Some of these points concern matters 
which  should  largely  be  determined  from  information  obtained  from  
sources outside the company being studied, while others are best solved by 
direct inquiry from company personnel. These ﬁfteen points are: 

 1.  Does the company have products or services  

with sufﬁcient market potential to make possible a  
sizable increase in sales for at least several years? 

It is by no means impossible to make a fair one-time proﬁt from com- 
panies  with  a  stationary  or  even  a  declining  sales  curve.  Operating 

4 7

4 8  

economies  resulting  from  better  control  of  costs  can  at  times  create 
enough improvement in net income to produce an increase in the mar-
ket price of a company’s shares. This sort of one-time proﬁt is eagerly 
sought by many speculators and bargain hunters. It does not offer the 
degree  of  opportunity,  however,  that  should  interest  those  desiring  to 
make the greatest possible gains from their investment funds. 

Neither  does  another  type  of  situation  which  sometimes  offers  a 
considerably  larger  degree  of  proﬁt.  Such  a  situation  occurs  when  a 
changed condition opens up a large increase in sales for a period of a very 
few years, after which sales stop growing. A large-scale example of this  
is what happened to the many radio set manufacturers with the com- 
mercial  development  of  television. A  huge  increase  in  sales  occurred 
for several years. Now that nearly 90 per cent of United States homes 
that  are  wired  for  electricity  have  television  sets,  the  sales  curve  is 
again  static.  In  the  case  of  a  great  many  companies  in  the  industry,  a 
large proﬁt was made by those who bought early enough. Then as the  
sales  curve  leveled  out,  so  did  the  attractiveness  of  many  of  these  
stocks. 

Not even the most outstanding growth companies need necessar- 
ily be expected to show sales for every single year larger than those of  
the  year  before.  In  another  chapter  I  will  attempt  to  show  why  the  
normal  intricacies  of  commercial  research  and  the  problems  of  mar- 
keting new products tend to cause such sales increases to come in an 
irregular series of uneven spurts rather than in a smooth year-by-year 
progression. The  vagaries  of  the  business  cycle  will  also  have  a  major 
inﬂuence  on  year-to-year  comparisons. Therefore  growth  should  not  
be  judged  on  an  annual  basis  but,  say,  by  taking  units  of  several  years 
each.  Certain  companies  give  promise  of  greater  than  normal  growth 
not  only  for  the  next  several-year  period,  but  also  for  a  considerable 
time beyond that. 

Those companies which decade by decade have consistently shown 
spectacular growth might be divided into two groups. For lack of bet-
ter terms I will call one group those that happen to be both “fortunate 
and able” and the other group those that are “fortunate because they are 
able.” A high order of management ability is a must for both groups. No 
company grows for a long period of years just because it is lucky. It must 
have and continue to keep a high order of business skill, otherwise it will 
not be able to capitalize on its good fortune and to defend its compet- 
itive position from the inroads of others. 

What to Buy 

4 9 

The Aluminum Company of America is an example of the “fortu- 
nate  and  able”  group. The  founders  of  this  company  were  men  with 
great vision.They correctly foresaw important commercial uses for their 
new product. However, neither they nor anyone else at that time could 
foresee anything like the full size of the market for aluminum products 
that was to develop over the next seventy years. A combination of tech-
nical developments and economies, of which the company was far more 
the beneﬁciary than the instigator, was to bring this about. Alcoa has and  
continues  to  show  a  high  order  of  skill  in  encouraging  and  taking 
advantage of these trends. However, if background conditions, such as 
the  perfecting  of  airborne  transportation,  had  not  caused  inﬂuences 
completely beyond Alcoa’s control to open up extensive new markets, 
the company would still have grown—but at a slower rate. 

The Aluminum Company was fortunate in ﬁnding itself in an even 
better industry than the attractive one envisioned by its early manage- 
ment.The fortunes made by many of the early stockholders of this com- 
pany who held on to their shares is of course known to everyone. What 
may not be so generally recognized is how well even relative newcom- 
ers to the stockholder list have done. When I wrote the original edition, 
Alcoa shares were down almost 40 per cent from the all-time high made 
in 1956.Yet at this “low” price the stock showed an increase in value of  
almost  500  per  cent  over  not  the  low  price,  but  the  median  average 
price  at  which  it  could  have  been  purchased  in  1947,  just  ten  years 
before. 

Now  let  us  take  Du  Pont  as  an  example  of  the  other  group  of 
growth stocks—those which I have described as “fortunate because they 
are  able.” This  company  was  not  originally  in  the  business  of  making 
nylon,  cellophane,  lucite,  neoprene,  orlon,  milar,  or  any  of  the  many 
other glamorous products with which it is frequently associated in the 
public mind and which have proven so spectacularly proﬁtable to the 
investor.  For  many  years  Du  Pont  made  blasting  powder.  In  time  of  
peace its growth would largely have paralleled that of the mining industry. 
In recent years, it might have grown a little more rapidly than this as 
additional sales volume accompanied increased activity in road building. 
None of this would have been more than an insigniﬁcant fraction of the 
volume of business that has developed, however, as the company’s bril- 
liant business and ﬁnancial judgment teamed up with superb technical 
skill to attain a sales volume that is now exceeding two billion dollars 
each  year.  Applying  the  skills  and  knowledge  learned  in  its  original 

 
5 0  

powder business, the company has successfully launched product after 
product to make one of the great success stories of American industry. 
The investment novice taking his ﬁrst look at the chemical indus-
try might think it is a fortunate coincidence that the companies which 
usually  have  the  highest  investment  rating  on  many  other  aspects  of 
their business are also the ones producing so many of the industry’s most 
attractive  growth  products.  Such  an  investor  is  confusing  cause  and 
effect to about the same degree as the unsophisticated young lady who 
returned from her ﬁrst trip to Europe and told her friends what a nice  
coincidence  it  was  that  wide  rivers  often  happened  to  ﬂow  right 
through the heart of so many of the large cities. Studies of the history 
of corporations such as Du Pont or Dow or Union Carbide show how 
clearly this type of company falls into the “fortunate because they are 
able” group so far as their sales curve is concerned. 

Possibly  one  of  the  most  striking  examples  of  these  “fortunate 
because they are able” companies is General American Transportation. 
A little over ﬁfty years ago when the company was formed, the railroad 
equipment industry appeared a good one with ample growth prospects.  
In  recent  years  few  industries  would  appear  to  offer  less  rewarding 
prospects  for  continued  growth. Yet  when  the  altered  outlook  for  the 
railroads began to make the prospects for the freight car builders increas- 
ingly  less  appealing,  brilliant  ingenuity  and  resourcefulness  kept  this 
company’s income on a steady uptrend. Not satisﬁed with this, the man- 
agement started taking advantage of some of the skills and knowledge 
learned in its basic business to go into other unrelated lines affording still 
further growth possibilities. 

A company which appears to have sharply increasing sales for some 
years  ahead  may  prove  to  be  a  bonanza  for  the  investor  regardless  of 
whether  such  a  company  more  closely  resembles  the “fortunate  and 
able” or the “fortunate because it is able” type. Nevertheless, examples 
such as General American Transportation make one thing clear. In either 
case  the  investor  must  be  alert  as  to  whether  the  management  is  and 
continues  to  be  of  the  highest  order  of  ability;  without  this,  the  sales 
growth will not continue. 

Correctly  judging  the  long-range  sales  curve  of  a  company  is  of 
extreme  importance  to  the  investor.  Superﬁcial  judgment  can  lead  to 
wrong conclusions. For example, I have already mentioned radio-television 
stocks as an instance where instead of continued long-range growth there 
was one major spurt as the homes of the nation acquired television sets. 

What to Buy 

5 1 

Nevertheless, in recent years certain of these radio-television companies 
have shown a new trend.They have used their electronic skills to build 
up sizable businesses in other electronic ﬁelds such as communication 
and automation equipment.These industrial and, in some cases, military 
electronic lines give promise of steady growth for many years to come.  
In a few of these companies, such as Motorola for example, they already 
are of more importance than the television operation. Meanwhile, cer-
tain  new  technical  developments  afford  a  possibility  that  in  the  early 
1960’s current model television sets will appear as awkward and obso-
lete  as  the  original  wall-type  crank-operated  hand  telephones  appear 
today. 

One potential development, color television, has possibly been ov- 
erdiscounted by the general public. Another is a direct result of transis- 
tor development and printed circuitry. It is a screen-type television with 
sets that would be little different in size and shape from the larger pic-
tures we now have on our walls.The present bulky cabinet would be a 
thing  of  the  past.  Should  such  developments  obtain  mass  commercial 
acceptance, a few of the technically most skillful of existing television 
companies  might  enjoy  another  major  spurt  in  sales  even  larger  and 
longer lasting than that which they experienced a few years ago. Such 
companies  would  ﬁnd  this  spurt  superimposed  on  a  steadily  growing 
industrial and military electronics business.They would then be enjoy-
ing the type of major sales growth which should be the ﬁrst point to be 
considered by those desiring the most proﬁtable type of investments. 

I have mentioned this example not as something which is sure to 
happen,  but  rather  as  something  which  could  easily  happen.  I  do  so 
because I believe that in regard to a company’s future sales curve there  
is one point that should always be kept in mind. If a company’s man- 
agement is outstanding and the industry is one subject to technological 
change and development research, the shrewd investor should stay alert 
to the possibility that management might handle company affairs so as  
to produce in the future exactly the type of sales curve that is the ﬁrst 
step to consider in choosing an outstanding investment. 

Since I wrote these words in the original edition, it might be inter- 
esting to note, not what “is sure to happen” or “may happen,” but what 
has happened in regard to Motorola. We are not yet in the early 1960’s, 
the closest time to which I refer as affording a possibility of developing 
television  models  that  will  obsolete  those  of  the  1950’s. This  has  not  
happened nor is it likely to do so in the near future. But in the meanwhile 

 
5 2  

let us see what an alert management has done to take advantage of tech- 
nological change to develop the type of upward sales curve that I stat- 
ed was the ﬁrst requisite of an outstanding investment. 

Motorola has made itself an outstanding leader in the ﬁeld of two-
way electronic communications that started out as a specialty for police 
cars  and  taxicabs,  and  now  appears  to  offer  almost  unlimited  growth. 
Trucking companies, owners of delivery ﬂeets of all types, public utili- 
ties, large construction projects, and pipe lines are but a few of the users 
of this type of versatile equipment. Meanwhile, after several years of cost- 
ly developmental effort, the company has established a semi-conductor 
(transistor) division on a proﬁtable basis which appears headed toward 
obtaining its share of the fabulous growth trend of that industry. It has 
become a major factor in the new ﬁeld of stereophonic phonographs 
and is obtaining an important and growing new source of sales in this 
way.  By  a  rather  unique  style  tie-in  with  a  leading  national  furniture 
manufacturer  (Drexel),  it  has  signiﬁcantly  increased  its  volume  in  the 
higher-priced end of its television line. Finally, through a small acquisi- 
tion it is just getting into the hearing-aid ﬁeld and may develop other 
new  specialties  as  well.  In  short,  while  some  time  in  the  next  decade 
important major stimulants may cause another large spurt in its original 
radio-television lines, this has not happened yet nor is it likely to hap-
pen  soon. Yet  management  has  taken  advantage  of  the  resources  and 
skills  within  the  organization  again  to  put  this  company  in  line  for 
growth. Is the stock market responding to this? When I ﬁnished writing 
the original edition, Motorola was 45½. Today it is 122. 

When  the  investor  is  alert  to  this  type  of  opportunity,  how  prof-
itable may it be? Let us take an actual example from the industry we  
have just been discussing. In 1947 a friend of mine in Wall Street was 
making a survey of the infant television industry. He studied approxi-
mately a dozen of the principal set producers over the better part of a 
year. His conclusion was that the business was going to be competitive, 
that there were going to be major shifts in position between the lead- 
ing  concerns,  and  that  certain  stocks  in  the  industry  had  speculative 
appeal. However, in the process of this survey it developed that one of 
the great shortages was the glass bulb for the picture tube.The most suc- 
cessful  producer  appeared  to  be  Corning  Glass Works.  After  further 
examination  of  the  technical  and  research  aspects  of  Corning  Glass 
Works it became apparent that this company was unusually well quali- 
ﬁed to produce these glass bulbs for the television industry. Estimates of 

What to Buy 

5 3 

the possible market indicated that this would be a major source of new 
business  for  the  company.  Since  prospects  for  other  product  lines 
seemed generally favorable, this analyst recommended the stock for both 
individual and institutional investment. The stock at that time was sell-
ing at about 20. It has since been split 2½-for-l and ten years after his 
purchase was selling at over 100, which was the equivalent of a price of 
250 on the old stock. 

 2.  Does the management have a determination to 
continue to develop products or processes that will still 
further increase total sales potentials when the growth 
potentials of currently attractive product 
lines have largely been exploited?

Companies which have a signiﬁcant growth prospect for the next few 
years because of new demand for existing lines, but which have neither 
policies nor plans to provide for further developments beyond this may 
provide a vehicle for a nice one-time proﬁt.They are not apt to provide  
the means for the consistent gains over ten or twenty-ﬁve years that are 
the  surest  route  to  ﬁnancial  success.  It  is  at  this  point  that  scientiﬁc 
research and development engineering begin to enter the picture. It is 
largely through these means that companies improve old products and 
develop new ones. This is the usual route by which a management not 
content with one isolated spurt of growth sees that growth occurs in a 
series of more or less continuous spurts. 

The  investor  usually  obtains  the  best  results  in  companies  whose 
engineering or research is to a considerable extent devoted to products 
having some business relationship to those already within the scope of 
company activities. This does not mean that a desirable company may 
not have a number of divisions, some of which have product lines quite 
different from others. It does mean that a company with research cen- 
tered around each of these divisions, like a cluster of trees each growing 
additional  branches  from  its  own  trunk,  will  usually  do  much  better  
than  a  company  working  on  a  number  of  unrelated  new  products 
which, if successful, will land it in several new industries unrelated to its 
existing business. 

At ﬁrst glance Point 2 may appear to be a mere repetition of Point 1. 
This is not the case. Point 1 is a matter of fact, appraising the degree of 
potential sales growth that now exists for a company’s product. Point 2 is 

 
5 4  

a matter of management attitude. Does the company now recognize that 
in time it will almost certainly have grown up to the potential of its pres-
ent market and that to continue to grow it may have to develop further 
new markets at some future time? It is the company that has both a good 
rating on the ﬁrst point and an afﬁrmative attitude on the second that is 
likely to be of the greatest investment interest. 

 3.  How effective are the company’s research  

and development efforts in relation to its size? 

For a large number of publicly-owned companies it is not too difﬁcult 
to get a ﬁgure showing the number of dollars being spent each year on 
research  and  development.  Since  virtually  all  such  companies  report 
their annual sales total, it is only a matter of the simplest mathematics to 
divide the research ﬁgure by total sales and so learn the per cent of each 
sales dollar that a company is devoting to this type of activity. Many pro- 
fessional investment analysts like to compare this research ﬁgure for one 
company with that of others in the same general ﬁeld. Sometimes they 
compare it with the average of the industry, by averaging the ﬁgures of 
many  somewhat  similar  companies.  From  this,  conclusions  are  drawn 
both as to the importance of a company’s research effort in relation to 
competition  and  the  amount  of  research  per  share  of  stock  that  the 
investor is getting in a particular company. 

Figures  of  this  sort  can  prove  a  crude  yardstick  that  may  give  a 
worthwhile  hint  that  one  company  is  doing  an  abnormal  amount  of 
research or another not nearly enough. But unless a great deal of further 
knowledge is obtained, such ﬁgures can be misleading. One reason for 
this is that companies vary enormously in what they include or exclude 
as research and development expense. One company will include a type 
of engineering expense that most authorities would not consider gen-
uine research at all, since it is really tailoring an existing product to a par- 
ticular  order—in  other  words,  sales  engineering.  Conversely,  another 
company will charge the expense of operating a pilot plant on a com-
pletely  new  product  to  production  rather  than  research.  Most  experts 
would  call  this  a  pure  research  function,  since  it  is  directly  related  to 
obtaining the know-how to make a new product. If all companies were 
to report research on a comparable accounting basis, the relative ﬁgures 
on  the  amount  of  research  done  by  various  well-known  companies 
might look quite different from those frequently used in ﬁnancial circles.

In no other major subdivision of business activity are to be found 
such great variations from one company to another between what goes 
in as expense and what comes out in beneﬁts as occurs in research. Even 
among  the  best-managed  companies  this  variation  seems  to  run  in  a 
ratio of as much as two to one. By this is meant some well-run compa- 
nies will get as much as twice the ultimate gain for each research dollar 
spent as will others. If averagely-run companies are included, this vari-
ation between the best and the mediocre is still greater. This is largely 
because the big strides in the way of new products and processes are no 
longer  the  work  of  a  single  genius. They  come  from  teams  of  highly 
trained  men,  each  with  a  different  specialty.  One  may  be  a  chemist, 
another a solid state physicist, a third a metallurgist and a fourth a math- 
ematician. The  degree  of  skill  of  each  of  these  experts  is  only  part  of 
what  is  needed  to  produce  outstanding  results.  It  is  also  necessary  to 
have  leaders  who  can  coordinate  the  work  of  people  of  such  diverse 
backgrounds  and  keep  them  driving  toward  a  common  goal.  Conse-
quently,  the  number  or  prestige  of  research  workers  in  one  company 
may be overshadowed by the effectiveness with which they are being 
helped to work as a team in another. 

Nor is a management’s ability to coordinate diverse technical skills 
into a closely-knit team and to stimulate each expert on that team to his 
greatest  productivity  the  only  kind  of  complex  coordination  upon 
which optimum research results depend. Close and detailed coordina- 
tion between research workers on each developmental project and those 
thoroughly familiar with both production and sales problems is almost 
as important. It is no simple task for management to bring about this 
close relationship between research, production, and sales.Yet unless this 
is  done,  new  products  as  ﬁnally  conceived  frequently  are  either  not 
designed to be manufactured as cheaply as possible, or, when designed,  
fail to have maximum sales appeal. Such research usually results in products 
vulnerable to more efﬁcient competition. 

Finally there is one other type of coordination necessary if research 
expenditures  are  to  attain  maximum  efﬁciency. This  is  coordination 
with top management. It might perhaps better be called top manage- 
ment’s  understanding  of  the  fundamental  nature  of  commercial 
research. Development projects cannot be expanded in good years and 
sharply  curtailed  in  poor  ones  without  tremendously  increasing  the  
total  cost  of  reaching  the  desired  objective. The “crash”  programs  so 
loved by a few top managements may occasionally be necessary but are 

 
5 6  

often just expensive. A crash program is what occurs when important 
elements of the research personnel are suddenly pulled from the proj-
ects on which they have been working and concentrated on some new 
task which may have great importance at the moment but which, fre-
quently, is not worth all the disruption it causes.The essence of success- 
ful commercial research is that only tasks be selected which promise to 
give  dollar  rewards  of  many  times  the  cost  of  the  research.  However, 
once a project is started, to allow budget considerations and other extra-
neous factors outside the project itself to curtail or accelerate it invari-
ably expands the total cost in relation to the beneﬁts obtained. 

Some  top  managements  do  not  seem  to  understand  this.  I  have 
heard  executives  of  small  but  successful  electronic  companies  express 
surprisingly  little  fear  of  the  competition  of  one  of  the  giants  of  the 
industry. This lack of worry concerning the ability of the much larger 
company to produce competitive products is not due to lack of respect 
for  the  capabilities  of  the  larger  company’s  individual  researchers  or 
unawareness of what might otherwise be accomplished with the large 
sums the big company regularly spends on research. Rather it is the his- 
toric tendency of this larger company to interrupt regular research proj-
ects with crash programs to attain the immediate goals of top manage- 
ment that has produced this feeling. Similarly, some years ago I heard 
that while they desired no publicity on the matter for obvious reasons, 
an outstanding technical college quietly advised its graduating class to 
avoid  employment  with  a  certain  oil  company. This  was  because  top 
management of that company had a tendency to hire highly skilled peo-
ple for what would normally be about ﬁve-year projects.Then in about 
three years the company would lose interest in the particular project and 
abandon it, thereby not only wasting their own money but preventing 
those employed from gaining the technical reputation for accomplish- 
ment that otherwise might have come to them. 

Another  factor  making  proper  investment  evaluation  of  research 
even  more  complex  is  how  to  evaluate  the  large  amount  of  research 
related to defense contracts. A great deal of such research is frequently 
done not at the expense of the company doing it, but for the account of 
the federal government. Some of the subcontractors in the defense ﬁeld 
also do signiﬁcant research for the account of the contractors whom they 
are supplying. Should such totals be appraised by the investor as being as 
signiﬁcant as research done at a company’s own expense? If not, how 
should it be valued in relation to company-sponsored research? Like so 

What to Buy 

5 7 

many  other  phases  in  the  investment  ﬁeld,  these  matters  cannot  be 
answered by mathematical formulae. Each case is different. 

The proﬁt margin on defense contracts is smaller than that of non- 
government business, and the nature of the work is often such that the 
contract for a new weapon is subject to competitive bidding from gov- 
ernment blueprints. This means that it is sometimes impossible to build 
up  steady  repeat  business  for  a  product  developed  by  government- 
sponsored research in a way that can be done with privately sponsored 
research, where both patents and customer goodwill can frequently be 
brought  into  play.  For  reasons  like  these,  from  the  standpoint  of  the 
investor there are enormous variations in the economic worth of dif- 
ferent government-sponsored research projects, even though such proj-
ects might be roughly equal in their importance so far as the beneﬁts to 
the  defense  effort  are  concerned. The  following  theoretical  example 
might serve to show how three such projects might have vastly different 
values to the investor: 

One project might produce a magniﬁcent new weapon having no 
non-military applications.The rights to this weapon would all be owned 
by the government and, once invented, it would be sufﬁciently simple 
to manufacture that the company which had done the research would 
have  no  advantage  over  others  in  bidding  for  a  production  contract. 
Such a research effort would have almost no value to the investor. 

Another project might produce the same weapon, but the technique 
of  manufacturing  might  be  sufﬁciently  complex  that  a  company  not 
participating in the original development work would have great difﬁ-
culty trying to make it. Such a research project would have moderate 
value to the investor since it would tend to assure continuous, though 
probably not highly proﬁtable, business from the government. 

Still  another  company  might  engineer  such  a  weapon  and  in  so 
doing might learn principles and new techniques directly applicable to 
its  regular  commercial  lines,  which  presumably  show  a  higher  proﬁt 
margin. Such a research project might have great value to the investor. 
Some of the most spectacularly successful companies of the recent past  
have been those that show a high order of talent for ﬁnding complex  
and technical defense work, the doing of which provides them at gov- 
ernment expense with know-how that can legitimately be transferred 
into  proﬁtable  non-defense  ﬁelds  related  to  their  existing  commercial 
activities.  Such  companies  are  providing  the  government  the  research 
results the defense authorities vitally need. However, at the same time 

 
5 8  

they are obtaining, at little or no cost, related non-defense research ben-
eﬁts  which  otherwise  they  would  probably  be  paying  for  themselves. 
This factor may well have been one of the reasons for the spectacular 
investment success of Texas Instruments, Inc., which in four years rose 
nearly 500 per cent from the price of 5¼ at which it traded when ﬁrst 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1953; it may also have con- 
tributed, in the same period, to the even greater 700 per cent rise expe- 
rienced  by Ampex  shareholders  from  the  time  this  company’s  shares 
were ﬁrst offered to the public in the same year. 

Finally, in judging the relative investment value of company research 
organizations, another type of activity must be evaluated. This is some-
thing which ordinarily is not considered as developmental research at 
all—the seemingly unrelated ﬁeld of market research. Market research 
may  be  regarded  as  the  bridge  between  developmental  research  and 
sales.Top management must be alert against the temptation to spend sig- 
niﬁcant sums on the research and development of a colorful product or 
process which, when perfected, has a genuine market but one too small 
to be proﬁtable. By too small to be proﬁtable I mean one that never will 
enjoy a large enough sales volume to get back the cost of the research, 
much less a worthwhile proﬁt for the investor. A market research organ- 
ization that can steer a major research effort of its company from one 
project which if technically successful would have barely paid for itself, 
to another which might cater to so much broader a market that it would 
pay out three times as well, would have vastly increased the value to its 
stockholders of that company’s scientiﬁc manpower. 

If quantitative measurements—such as the annual expenditures on 
research  or  the  number  of  employees  holding  scientiﬁc  degrees—are 
only a rough guide and not the ﬁnal answer to whether a company has  
an  outstanding  research  organization,  how  does  the  careful  investor  
obtain this information? Once again it is surprising what the “scuttle- 
butt” method will produce. Until the average investor tries it, he prob-
ably  will  not  believe  how  complete  a  picture  will  emerge  if  he  asks 
intelligent questions about a company’s research activities of a diversi- 
ﬁed group of research people, some from within the company and oth- 
ers engaged in related lines in competitive industries, in universities, and 
in government. A simpler and often worthwhile method is to make a 
close  study  of  how  much  in  dollar  sales  or  net  proﬁts  has  been  con- 
tributed to a company by the results of its research organization during 
a particular span, such as the prior ten years. An organization which in 

What to Buy 

5 9 

relation to the size of its activities has produced a good ﬂow of prof- 
itable new products during such a period will probably be equally pro- 
ductive in the future as long as it continues to operate under the same 
general methods. 

 4.  Does the company have an above-average  

sales organization? 

In this competitive age, the products or services of few companies are 
so outstanding that they will sell to their maximum potentialities if they 
are not expertly merchandised. It is the making of a sale that is the most 
basic single activity of any business.Without sales, survival is impossible. 
It  is  the  making  of  repeat  sales  to  satisﬁed  customers  that  is  the  ﬁrst  
benchmark of success.Yet, strange as it seems, the relative efﬁciency of a 
company’s  sales,  advertising,  and  distributive  organizations  receives  far 
less attention from most investors, even the careful ones, than do pro- 
duction,  research,  ﬁnance,  or  other  major  subdivisions  of  corporate 
activity. 

There is probably a reason for this. It is relatively easy to construct 
simple mathematical ratios that will provide some sort of guide to the 
attractiveness of a company’s production costs, research activity, or ﬁnan-
cial structure in comparison with its competitors. It is a great deal harder 
to make ratios that have even a semblance of meaning in regard to sales 
and distribution efﬁciency. In regard to research we have already seen 
that such simple ratios are far too crude to provide anything but the ﬁrst 
clues as to what to look for. Their value in relation to production and 
the  ﬁnancial  structure  will  be  discussed  shortly.  However,  whether  or  
not  such  ratios  have  anything  like  the  value  frequently  placed  upon 
them in ﬁnancial circles, the fact remains that investors like to lean upon 
them. Because sales effort does not readily lend itself to this type of for- 
mulae, many investors fail to appraise it at all in spite of its basic impor-
tance in determining real investment worth. 

Again, the way out of this dilemma lies in the use of the “scuttle- 
butt” technique. Of all the phases of a company’s activity, none is easier 
to learn about from sources outside the company than the relative efﬁ-
ciency  of  a  sales  organization.  Both  competitors  and  customers  know 
the answers. Equally important, they are seldom hesitant to express their 
views.The time spent by the careful investor in inquiring into this subject 
is usually richly rewarded.

I am devoting less space to this matter of relative sales ability than I 
did to the matter of relative research ability. This does not mean that I 
consider it less important. In today’s competitive world, many things are 
important to corporate success. However, outstanding production, sales, 
and research may be considered the three main columns upon which 
such success is based. Saying that one is more important than another is 
like  saying  that  the  heart,  the  lungs,  or  the  digestive  tract  is  the  most 
important single organ for the proper functioning of the body. All are 
needed for survival, and all must function well for vigorous health. Look 
around you at the companies that have proven outstanding investments. 
Try  to  ﬁnd  some  that  do  not  have  both  aggressive  distribution  and  a 
constantly improving sales organization. 

I have already referred to the Dow Chemical Company and may do 
so several times again, as I believe this company, which over the years 
has proven so rewarding to its stockholders, is an outstanding example 
of  the  ideal  conservative  long-range  investment.  Here  is  a  company 
which in the public mind is almost synonymous with outstandingly suc- 
cessful research. However, what is not as well known is that this com-
pany selects and trains its sales personnel with the same care as it han-
dles its research chemists. Before a young college graduate becomes a 
Dow salesman, he may be invited to make several trips to Midland so 
that both he and the company can become as sure as possible that he  
has the background and temperament that will ﬁt him into their sales 
organization. Then,  before  he  so  much  as  sees  his  ﬁrst  potential  cus-
tomer, he must undergo specialized training that occasionally lasts only  
a few weeks but at times continues for well over a year to prepare him 
for the more complex selling jobs.This is but the beginning of the train- 
ing  he  will  receive;  some  of  the  company’s  greatest  mental  effort  is 
devoted to seeking and frequently ﬁnding more efﬁcient ways to solicit 
from, service, and deliver to the customer. 

Are  Dow  and  the  other  outstanding  companies  in  the  chemical 
industry  unique  in  this  great  attention  paid  to  sales  and  distribution? 
Deﬁnitely  not.  In  another  and  quite  different  industry,  International 
Business  Machines  is  a  company  which  has  (speaking  conservatively) 
handsomely  rewarded  its  owners. An  IBM  executive  recently  told  me 
that  the  average  salesman  spends  a  third  of  his  entire  time  training  in 
company-sponsored schools! To a considerable degree this amazing ratio 
results from an attempt to keep the sales force abreast of a rapidly chang-
ing  technology.  Nevertheless  I  believe  it  one  more  indication  of  the 

 
6 2  

weight that most successful companies give to steadily improving their  
sales  arm.  A  one-time  proﬁt  can  be  made  in  the  company  which 
because  of  manufacturing  or  research  skill  obtains  some  worthwhile 
business  without  a  strong  distribution  organization.  However,  such 
companies  can  be  quite  vulnerable.  For  steady  long-term  growth  a 
strong sales arm is vital. 

 5.  Does the company have a worthwhile  

proﬁt margin? 

Here  at  last  is  a  subject  of  importance  which  properly  lends  itself  to  
the type of mathematical analysis which so many ﬁnancial people feel 
is the backbone of sound investment decisions. From the standpoint of 
the investor, sales are only of value when and if they lead to increased 
proﬁts. All the sales growth in the world won’t produce the right type  
of investment vehicle if, over the years, proﬁts do not grow correspond- 
ingly. The ﬁrst step in examining proﬁts is to study a company’s proﬁt 
margin, that is, to determine the number of cents of each dollar of sales 
that is brought down to operating proﬁt. The wide variation between 
different companies, even those in the same industry, will immediately 
become apparent. Such a study should be made, not for a single year, but 
for a series of years. It then becomes evident that nearly all companies 
have broader proﬁt margins—as well as greater total dollar proﬁts—in  
years  when  an  industry  is  unusually  prosperous.  However,  it  also 
becomes  clear  that  the  marginal  companies—that  is,  those  with  the 
smaller proﬁt margins—nearly always increase their proﬁt margins by a  
considerably  greater  percentage  in  the  good  years  than  do  the  lower- 
cost companies, whose proﬁt margins also get better but not to so great 
a  degree. This  usually  causes  the  weaker  companies  to  show  a  greater 
percentage increase in earnings in a year of abnormally good business 
than do the stronger companies in the same ﬁeld. However, it should 
also  be  remembered  that  these  earnings  will  decline  correspondingly 
more rapidly when the business tide turns. 

For  this  reason  I  believe  that  the  greatest  long-range  investment 
proﬁts are never obtained by investing in marginal companies.The only 
reason for considering a long-range investment in a company with an 
abnormally low proﬁt margin is that there might be strong indications 
that  a  fundamental  change  is  taking  place  within  the  company. This  
would  be  such  that  the  improvement  in  proﬁt  margins  would  be 

What to Buy 

6 3 

occurring  for  reasons  other  than  a  temporarily  expanded  volume  of 
business.  In  other  words,  the  company  would  not  be  marginal  in  the 
true sense of the word, since the real reason for buying is that efﬁciency 
or  new  products  developed  within  the  company  have  taken  it  out  of  
the  marginal  category. When  such  internal  changes  are  taking  place  
in  a  corporation  which  in  other  respects  pretty  well  qualiﬁes  as  the 
right type of long-range investment, it may be an unusually attractive 
purchase. 

So  far  as  older  and  larger  companies  are  concerned,  most  of  the  
really big investment gains have come from companies having relative- 
ly  broad  proﬁt  margins.  Usually  they  have  among  the  best  such  mar-
gins in their industry. In regard to young companies, and occasionally 
older ones, there is one important deviation from this rule—a deviation, 
however, that is generally more apparent than real. Such companies will 
at times deliberately elect to speed up growth by spending all or a very  
large  part  of  the  proﬁts  they  would  otherwise  have  earned  on  even 
more research or on even more sales promotion than they would oth- 
erwise  be  doing.  What  is  important  in  such  instances  is  to  make  
absolutely  certain  that  it  is  actually  still  further  research,  still  further  
sales  promotion,  or  still  more  of  any  other  activity  which  is  being 
ﬁnanced today so as to build for the future, that is the real cause of the 
narrow or non-existent proﬁt margin. 

The greatest care should be used to be sure that the volume of the 
activities being credited with reducing the proﬁt margin is not merely 
the  volume  of  these  activities  needed  for  a  good  rate  of  growth,  but 
actually represents even more research, sales promotion, etc., than this. 
When  this  happens,  the  research  company  with  an  apparently  poor  
proﬁt margin may be an unusually attractive investment. However, with 
the exception of companies of this type in which the low proﬁt margin 
is  being  deliberately  engineered  in  order  to  further  accelerate  the  
growth rate, investors desiring maximum gains over the years had best 
stay away from low-proﬁt-margin or marginal companies. 

 6. What is the company doing to maintain or  

improve proﬁt margins? 

The success of a stock purchase does not depend on what is generally 
known  about  a  company  at  the  time  the  purchase  is  made.  Rather  it 
depends upon what gets to be known about it after the stock has been 

 
6 4  

bought. Therefore it is not the proﬁt margins of the past but those of  
the future that are basically important to the investor. 

In the age in which we live, there seems to be a constant threat to 
proﬁt margins.Wages and salary costs go up year by year. Many compa- 
nies now have long-range labor contracts calling for still further increases 
for several years ahead. Rising labor costs result in corresponding increases 
in raw materials and supplies.The trend of tax rates, particularly real estate 
and local tax rates, also seems to be steadily increasing. Against this back- 
ground, different companies are going to have different results in the trend 
of their proﬁt margins. Some companies are in the seemingly fortunate 
position that they can maintain proﬁt margins simply by raising prices. 
This is usually because they are in industries in which the demand for 
their products is abnormally strong or because the selling prices of com- 
petitive products have gone up even more than their own. In our econo- 
my, however, maintaining or improving proﬁt margins in this way usual- 
ly  proves  a  relatively  temporary  matter.  This  is  because  additional 
competitive production capacity is created.This new capacity sufﬁciently 
outbalances the increased gain so that, in time, cost increases can no longer 
be passed on as price increases. Proﬁt margins then start to shrink. 

A striking example of this is the abrupt change that occurred in the 
fall of 1956, when the aluminum market went in a few weeks from a 
condition of short supply to one of aggressive competitive selling. Prior 
to that time aluminum prices rose about with costs. Unless demand for 
the  product  should  grow  even  faster  than  production  facilities,  future 
price increases will occur less rapidly. Similarly the persistent disinclina- 
tion of some of the largest steel producers to raise prices of certain classes  
of  scarce  steel  products  to “all  the  market  would  bear”  may  in  part 
reﬂect long-range thinking about the temporary nature of broad proﬁt  
margins  that  arise  from  no  other  cause  than  an  ability  to  pass  on  
increased costs by higher selling prices. 

The  long-range  danger  of  this  is  perhaps  best  illustrated  by  what 
happened to the leading copper producers during this same second half 
of 1956.These companies used considerable self-restraint, even going so 
far as to sell under world prices in an attempt to keep prices from going 
too high. Nevertheless, copper rose sufﬁciently to curtail demand and 
attract  new  supply.  Aggravated  by  curtailed Western  European  con- 
sumption  resulting  from  the  closing  of  the  Suez  Canal,  the  situation 
became quite unbalanced. It is probable that 1957 proﬁt margins were 
noticeably poorer than would have been the case if those of 1956 had 

What to Buy 

6 5 

not been so good.When proﬁt margins of a whole industry rise because 
of  repeated  price  increases,  the  indication  is  not  a  good  one  for  the 
long-range investor. 

In  contrast,  certain  other  companies,  including  some  within  these 
same industries, manage to improve proﬁt margins by far more ingenious 
means than just raising prices. Some companies achieve great success by 
maintaining capital-improvement or product-engineering departments. 
The sole function of such departments is to design new equipment that 
will  reduce  costs  and  thus  offset  or  partially  offset  the  rising  trend  of 
wages. Many companies are constantly reviewing procedures and meth-
ods to see where economies can be brought about.The accounting func- 
tion and the handling of records has been a particularly fertile ﬁeld for 
this sort of activity. So has the transportation ﬁeld. Shipping costs have 
risen more than most expenses because of the larger percentage of labor 
costs in most forms of transportation as compared to most types of man- 
ufacturing. Using new types of containers, heretofore unused methods of 
transportation, or even putting in branch plants to avoid cross-hauling 
have all cut costs for alert companies. 

None of these things can be brought about in a day.They all require 
close  study  and  considerable  planning  ahead. The  prospective  investor 
should  give  attention  to  the  amount  of  ingenuity  of  the  work  being 
done on new ideas for cutting costs and improving proﬁt margins. Here 
the “scuttlebutt”  method  may  prove  of  some  value,  but  much  less  so 
than direct inquiry from company personnel. Fortunately, this is a ﬁeld 
about which most top executives will talk in some detail.The compa- 
nies which are doing the most successful work along this line are very 
likely  to  be  the  ones  which  have  built  up  the  organization  with  the 
know-how to continue to do constructive things in the future. They are 
extremely  likely  to  be  in  the  group  offering  the  greatest  long-range 
rewards to their shareholders. 

 7.  Does the company have outstanding labor and  

personnel relations? 

Most investors may not fully appreciate the proﬁts from good labor rela-
tions. Few of them fail to recognize the impact of bad labor relations. 
The effect on production of frequent and prolonged strikes is obvious 
to anyone making even the most cursory review of corporate ﬁnancial 
statements. 

 
6 6  

However,  the  difference  in  the  degree  of  proﬁtability  between  a 
company  with  good  personnel  relations  and  one  with  mediocre  per- 
sonnel relations is far greater than the direct cost of strikes. If workers 
feel that they are fairly treated by their employer, a background has been 
laid  wherein  efﬁcient  leadership  can  accomplish  much  in  increasing 
productivity per worker. Furthermore, there is always considerable cost 
in training each new worker.Those companies with an abnormal labor 
turnover have therefore an element of unnecessary expense avoided by 
better-managed enterprises. 

But how does the investor properly judge the quality of a company’s 
labor  and  personnel  relations? There  is  no  simple  answer. There  is  no  
set yardstick that will apply in all cases. About the best that can be done 
is to look at a number of factors and then judge from the composite 
picture. 

In  this  day  of  widespread  unionization,  those  companies  that  still 
have no union or a company union probably also have well above aver-
age labor and personnel relations. If they did not, the unions would have 
organized them long ago.The investor can feel rather sure, for example, 
that Motorola, located in highly unionized Chicago, and Texas Instru- 
ments, Inc., in increasingly unionized Dallas, have convinced at least an 
important part of their work force of the company’s genuine desire and 
ability  to  treat  its  employees  well.  Lack  of  afﬁliation  with  an  interna- 
tional union can only be explained by successful personnel policies in 
instances of this sort. 

On the other hand, unionization is by no means a sign of poor labor 
relations. Some of the companies with the very best labor relations are 
completely unionized, but have learned to get along with their unions 
with a reasonable degree of mutual respect and trust. Similarly, while a 
record  of  constant  and  prolonged  strikes  is  a  good  indication  of  bad 
labor relations, the complete absence of strikes is not necessarily a sign  
of  fundamentally  good  relations.  Sometimes  the  company  with  no  
strikes is too much like the henpecked husband. Absence of conﬂict may 
not mean a basically happy relationship so much as fear of the conse-
quences of conﬂict. 

Why do workers feel unusually loyal to one employer and resentful 
of another? The reasons are often so complex and difﬁcult to trace that 
for the most part the investor may do better to concern himself with  
comparative  data  showing  how  workers  feel,  rather  than  with  an 
attempt to appraise each part of the background causing them to feel 

What to Buy 

6 7 

that way. One series of ﬁgures that indicates the underlying quality of 
labor and personnel policies is the relative labor turnover in one compa- 
ny as against another in the same area. Equally signiﬁcant is the relative 
size of the waiting list of job applicants wanting to work for one com-
pany as against others in the same locality. In an area where there is no 
labor  surplus,  companies  having  an  abnormally  long  list  of  personnel 
seeking to enter their employ are usually companies that are desirable for 
investment from the standpoint of good labor and personnel relations. 

Nevertheless, beyond these general ﬁgures there are a few speciﬁc 
details the investor might notice. Companies with good labor relations 
usually  are  ones  making  every  effort  to  settle  grievances  quickly. The 
small individual grievances that take long to settle and are not consid- 
ered important by management are ones that smoulder and ﬁnally ﬂare 
up  seriously.  In  addition  to  appraising  the  methods  set  up  for  settling 
grievances,  the  investor  might  also  pay  close  attention  to  wage  scales. 
The  company  that  makes  above-average  proﬁts  while  paying  above- 
average wages for the area in which it is located is likely to have good 
labor relations. The investor who buys into a situation in which a sig- 
niﬁcant part of earnings comes from paying below-standard wages for 
the area involved may in time have serious trouble on his hands. 

Finally  the  investor  should  be  sensitive  to  the  attitude  of  top 
management  toward  the  rank-and-ﬁle  employees.  Underneath  all  the 
ﬁne-sounding  generalities,  some  managements  have  little  feeling  of 
responsibility for, or interest in, their ordinary workers.Their chief con-
cern is that no greater share of their sales dollar go to lower echelon per- 
sonnel than the pressure of militant unionism makes mandatory. Workers 
are  readily  hired  or  dismissed  in  large  masses,  dependent  on  slight  
changes in the company’s sales outlook or proﬁt picture. No feeling of 
responsibility exists for the hardships this can cause to the families affect- 
ed. Nothing is done to make ordinary employees feel they are wanted, 
needed, and part of the business picture. Nothing is done to build up the 
dignity of the individual worker. Managements with this attitude do not 
usually provide the background for the most desirable type of investment. 

 8.  Does the company have outstanding  

executive relations? 

If having good relations with lower echelon personnel is important, cre-
ating the right atmosphere among executive personnel is vital.These are 

 
6 8  

the men whose judgment, ingenuity, and teamwork will in time make  
or break any venture. Because the stakes for which they play are high,  
the tension on the job is frequently great. So is the chance that friction 
or  resentment  might  create  conditions  whereby  top  executive  talent 
either does not stay with a company or does not produce to its maxi-
mum ability if it does stay. 

The  company  offering  greatest  investment  opportunities  will  be  
one  in  which  there  is  a  good  executive  climate.  Executives  will  have 
conﬁdence  in  their  president  and/or  board  chairman.  This  means,  
among other things, that from the lowest levels on up there is a feeling 
that promotions are based on ability, not factionalism. A ruling family is 
not promoted over the heads of more able men. Salary adjustments are 
reviewed  regularly  so  that  executives  feel  that  merited  increases  will 
come without having to be demanded. Salaries are at least in line with 
the  standard  of  the  industry  and  the  locality.  Management  will  bring  
outsiders into anything other than starting jobs only if there is no pos- 
sibility of ﬁnding anyone within the organization who can be promot- 
ed  to  ﬁll  the  position. Top  management  will  recognize  that  wherever 
human beings work together, some degree of factionalism and human 
friction will occur, but will not tolerate those who do not cooperate in 
team play so that such friction and factionalism is kept to an irreducible  
minimum.  Much  of  this  the  investor  can  usually  learn  without  too  
much  direct  questioning  by  chatting  about  the  company  with  a  few 
executives scattered at different levels of responsibility.The further a cor- 
poration departs from these standards, the less likely it is to be a really 
outstanding investment. 

 9.  Does the company have depth to its  

management? 

A small corporation can do extremely well and, if other factors are right, 
provide a magniﬁcent investment for a number of years under really able 
one-man  management.  However,  all  humans  are  ﬁnite,  so  even  for 
smaller companies the investor should have some idea of what can be 
done to prevent corporate disaster if the key man should no longer be 
available. Nowadays this investment risk with an otherwise outstanding 
small company is not as great as it seems, in view of the recent tenden- 
cy of big companies with plenty of management talent to buy up out- 
standing smaller units. 

What to Buy 

6 9 

However,  companies  worthy  of  investment  interest  are  those  that 
will continue to grow. Sooner or later a company will reach a size where 
it just will not be able to take advantage of further opportunities unless 
it starts developing executive talent in some depth. This point will vary 
between  companies,  depending  on  the  industry  in  which  they  are 
engaged  and  the  skill  of  the  one-man  management.  It  usually  occurs 
when annual sales totals reach a point somewhere between ﬁfteen and 
forty million dollars. Having the right executive climate, as discussed in 
Point 8, becomes of major investment signiﬁcance at this time. 

Those matters discussed in Point 8 are, of course, needed for devel- 
opment of proper management in depth. But such management will not 
develop  unless  certain  additional  policies  are  in  effect  as  well.  Most 
important of these is the delegation of authority. If from the very top on 
down, each level of executives is not given real authority to carry out 
assigned duties in as ingenious and efﬁcient a manner as each individ- 
ual’s  ability  will  permit,  good  executive  material  becomes  much  like 
healthy young animals so caged in that they cannot exercise. They do 
not develop their faculties because they just do not have enough oppor- 
tunity to use them. 

Those organizations where the top brass personally interfere with 
and  try  to  handle  routine  day-to-day  operating  matters  seldom  turn  
out  to  be  the  most  attractive  type  of  investments.  Cutting  across  the 
lines of authority which they themselves have set up frequently results 
in  well-meaning  executives  signiﬁcantly  detracting  from  the  invest- 
ment  caliber  of  the  companies  they  run.  No  matter  how  able  one  or  
two bosses may be in handling all this detail, once a corporation reach- 
es a certain size executives of this type will get in trouble on two fronts. 
Too much detail will have arisen for them to handle. Capable people  
just  are  not  being  developed  to  handle  the  still  further  growth  that 
should lie ahead. 

Another  matter  is  worthy  of  the  investor’s  attention  in  judging 
whether a company has suitable depth in management. Does top man- 
agement welcome and evaluate suggestions from personnel even if, at 
times,  those  suggestions  carry  with  them  adverse  criticism  of  current 
management practices? So competitive is today’s business world and so 
great the need for improvement and change that if pride or indifference 
prevent  top  management  from  exploring  what  has  frequently  been 
found to be a veritable gold mine of worthwhile ideas, the investment 
climate that results probably will not be the most suitable one for the 

 
7 0  

investor. Neither is it likely to be one in which increasing numbers of 
vitally needed younger executives are going to develop. 

 10.  How good are the company’s cost analysis  

and accounting controls? 

No  company  is  going  to  continue  to  have  outstanding  success  for  a  
long period of time if it cannot break down its over-all costs with suf-
ﬁcient  accuracy  and  detail  to  show  the  cost  of  each  small  step  in  its 
operation. Only in this way will a management know what most needs 
its  attention.  Only  in  this  way  can  management  judge  whether  it  is  
properly  solving  each  problem  that  does  need  its  attention.  Further- 
more,  most  successful  companies  make  not  one  but  a  vast  series  of 
products. If the management does not have a precise knowledge of the  
true  cost  of  each  product  in  relation  to  the  others,  it  is  under  an  
extreme  handicap.  It  becomes  almost  impossible  to  establish  pricing 
policies that will insure the maximum obtainable over-all proﬁt consis- 
tent with discouraging undue competition. There is no way of know- 
ing  which  products  are  worthy  of  special  sales  effort  and  promotion. 
Worst of all, some apparently successful activities may actually be oper-
ating at a loss and, unknown to management, may be decreasing rather 
than swelling the total of over-all proﬁts. Intelligent planning becomes 
almost impossible. 

In spite of the investment importance of accounting controls, it is  
usually  only  in  instances  of  extreme  inefﬁciency  that  the  careful  
investor  will  get  a  clear  picture  of  the  status  of  cost  accounting  and 
related  activities  in  a  company  in  which  he  is  contemplating  invest-
ment.  In  this  sphere,  the “scuttlebutt”  method  will  sometimes  reveal 
companies that are really deﬁcient. It will seldom tell much more than 
this.  Direct  inquiry  of  company  personnel  will  usually  elicit  a  com-
pletely  sincere  reply  that  the  cost  data  are  entirely  adequate.  Detailed 
cost sheets will often be shown in support of the statement. However,  
it is not so much the existence of detailed ﬁgures as their relative accu-
racy which is important. The best that the careful investor usually can 
do in this ﬁeld is to recognize both the importance of the subject and 
his own limitations in making a worthwhile appraisal of it.Within these 
limits  he  usually  can  only  fall  back  on  the  general  conclusion  that  a 
company well above average in most other aspects of business skill will 
probably be above average in this ﬁeld, too, as long as top management 

What to Buy 

7 1 

understands  the  basic  importance  of  expert  accounting  controls  and  
cost analysis. 

 11. Are there other aspects of the business,  

somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will  
give the investor important clues as to how outstanding  
the company may be in relation to its competition? 

By  deﬁnition,  this  is  somewhat  of  a  catch-all  point  of  inquiry. This  is 
because matters of this sort are bound to differ considerably from each 
other—those which are of great importance in some lines of business 
can, at times, be of little or no importance in others. For example, in 
most important operations involving retailing, the degree of skill a com-
pany  has  in  handling  real  estate  matters—the  quality  of  its  leases,  for 
instance—is of great signiﬁcance. In many other lines of business, a high 
degree of skill in this ﬁeld is less important. Similarly, the relative skill 
with which a company handles its credits is of great signiﬁcance to some 
companies, of minor or no importance to others. For both these matters, 
our old friend the “scuttlebutt” method will usually furnish the investor 
with a pretty clear picture. Frequently his conclusions can be checked 
against mathematical ratios such as comparative leasing costs per dollar 
of sales, or ratio of credit loss, if the point is of sufﬁcient importance to 
warrant careful study. 

In a number of lines of business, total insurance costs mount to an 
important per cent of the sales dollar. At times this can matter enough so 
that a company with, say, a 35 per cent lower overall insurance cost than 
a competitor of the same size will have a broader margin of proﬁt. In  
those industries where insurance is a big enough factor to affect earnings, 
a study of these ratios and a discussion of them with informed insurance 
people can be unusually rewarding to the investor. It gives a supplemen- 
tal but indicative check as to how outstanding a particular management 
may be. This is because these lower insurance costs do not come solely 
from a greater skill in handling insurance in the same way, for example, as 
skill  in  handling  real  estate  results  in  lower  than  average  leasing  costs. 
Rather they are largely the reﬂection of over-all skill in handling people, 
inventory, and ﬁxed property so as to reduce the over-all amount of acci- 
dent, damage, and waste and thereby make these lower costs possible. An 
index of insurance costs in relation to the coverage obtained points out 
clearly which companies in a given ﬁeld are well run. 

 
7 2  

Patents are another matter having varying signiﬁcance from com-
pany to company. For large companies, a strong patent position is usu-
ally  a  point  of  additional  rather  than  basic  strength.  It  usually  blocks  
off  certain  subdivisions  of  the  company’s  activities  from  the  intense 
competition that might otherwise prevail. This normally enables these 
segments of the company’s product lines to enjoy wider proﬁt margins 
than  would  otherwise  occur. This  in  turn  tends  to  broaden  the  aver- 
age  of  the  entire  line.  Similarly,  strong  patent  positions  may  at  times 
give a company exclusive rights to the easiest or cheapest way of mak- 
ing a particular product. Competitors must go a longer way round to 
get to the same place, thereby giving the patent owner a tangible com- 
petitive advantage although frequently a small one. 

In  our  era  of  widespread  technical  know-how  it  is  seldom  that  
large  companies  can  enjoy  more  than  a  small  part  of  their  activities  
in  areas  sheltered  by  patent  protection.  Patents  are  usually  able  to  
block  off  only  a  few  rather  than  all  the  ways  of  accomplishing  the  
same  result.  For  this  reason  many  large  companies  make  no  attempt 
to  shut  out  competition  through  patent  structure,  but  for  relatively 
modest  fees  license  competition  to  use  their  patents  and  in  return 
expect  the  same  treatment  from  these  licensees.  Influences  such  as 
manufacturing  know-how,  sales  and  service  organization,  customer 
good will, and knowledge of customer problems are depended on far 
more  than  patents  to  maintain  a  competitive  position.  In  fact,  when  
large  companies  depend  chiefly  on  patent  protection  for  the  main- 
tenance of their profit margin, it is usually  more a  sign  of investment 
weakness  than  strength.  Patents  do  not  run  on  indefinitely.  When  
the  patent  protection  is  no  longer  there,  the  company’s  profit  may  
suffer badly. 

The  young  company  just  starting  to  develop  its  production,  sales, 
and  service  organization,  and  in  the  early  stages  of  establishing  cus- 
tomer  good  will  is  in  a  very  different  position. Without  patents  its 
products  might  be  copied  by  large  entrenched  enterprises  which  
could  use  their  established  channels  of  customer  relationship  to  put  
the  small  young  competitor  out  of  business.  For  small  companies  in  
the  early  years  of  marketing  unique  products  or  services,  the  investor 
should  therefore  closely  scrutinize  the  patent  position.  He  should  get 
information  from  qualiﬁed  sources  as  to  how  broad  the  protection 
actually may be. It is one thing to get a patent on a device. It may be 
quite  another  to  get  protection  that  will  prevent  others  from  making  

What to Buy 

7 3 

it  in  a  slightly  different  way.  Even  here,  however,  engineering  that  is 
constantly improving the product can prove considerably more advan- 
tageous than mere static patent protection. 

For example, a few years ago when it was a much smaller organ- 
ization  than  as  of  today,  a  young West  Coast  electronic  manufacturer 
had great success with a new product. One of the giants of the indus- 
try made what was described to me as a “Chinese copy” and market- 
ed  it  under  its  well-known  trade  name.  In  the  opinion  of  the  young  
company’s designer, this large competitor managed to engineer all the 
small  company’s  engineering  mistakes  into  the  model  along  with  
the good points.The large company’s model came out at just the time 
the  small  manufacturer  introduced  its  own  improved  model  with 
the  weak  points  eliminated.With  a  product  that  was  not  selling,  the 
large company withdrew from the ﬁeld. As has been true many times  
before  and  since,  it  is  the  constant  leadership  in  engineering,  not 
patents,  that  is  the  fundamental  source  of  protection.  The  investor  
must  be  at  least  as  careful  not  to  place  too  much  importance  on  
patent  protection  as  to  recognize  its  signiﬁcance  in  those  occasional 
places  where  it  is  a  major  factor  in  appraising  the  attractiveness  of  a 
desirable investment. 

 12.  Does the company have a short-range or  
long-range outlook in regard to proﬁts? 

Some  companies  will  conduct  their  affairs  so  as  to  gain  the  greatest 
possible  proﬁt  right  now.  Others  will  deliberately  curtail  maximum 
immediate proﬁts to build up good will and thereby gain greater over-
all proﬁts over a period of years. Treatment of customers and vendors 
gives  frequent  examples  of  this.  One  company  will  constantly  make  
the  sharpest  possible  deals  with  suppliers.  Another  will  at  times  pay  
above contract price to a vendor who has had unexpected expense in 
making  delivery,  because  it  wants  to  be  sure  of  having  a  dependable 
source  of  needed  raw  materials  or  high-quality  components  available 
when the market has turned and supplies may be desperately needed. 
The  difference  in  treatment  of  customers  is  equally  noticeable. The 
company that will go to special trouble and expense to take care of the 
needs  of  a  regular  customer  caught  in  an  unexpected  jam  may  show 
lower  proﬁts  on  the  particular  transaction,  but  far  greater  proﬁts  over 
the years. 

 
7 4  

The “scuttlebutt” method usually reﬂects these differences in poli-
cies  quite  clearly. The  investor  wanting  maximum  results  should  favor 
companies with a truly long-range outlook concerning proﬁts. 

 13.  In the foreseeable future will the growth of the  
company require sufﬁcient equity ﬁnancing so that the  
larger number of shares then outstanding will largely  
cancel the existing stockholders’ beneﬁt from this  
anticipated growth? 

The typical book on investment devotes so much space to a discussion 
on  the  corporation’s  cash  position,  corporate  structure,  percentage  of 
capitalization  in  various  classes  of  securities,  etc.,  that  it  may  well  be 
asked why these purely ﬁnancial aspects should not be given more than 
the amount of space devoted to this one point out of a total of ﬁfteen. 
The reason is that it is the basic contention of this book that the intel- 
ligent investor should not buy common stocks simply because they are 
cheap but only if they give promise of major gain to him. 

Only a small percentage of all companies can qualify with a high rat- 
ing for all or nearly all of the other fourteen points listed in this discus- 
sion. Any company which can so qualify could easily borrow money, at 
prevailing rates for its size company, up to the accepted top percentage 
of debt for that kind of business. If such a company needed more cash 
once this top debt limit has been reached—always assuming of course 
that it qualiﬁes at or near the top in regard to further sales growth, prof- 
it margins, management, research, and the various other points we are 
now considering—it could still raise equity money at some price, since 
investors are always eager to participate in ventures of this sort. 

Therefore, if investment is limited to outstanding situations, what real- 
ly matters is whether the company’s cash plus further borrowing ability is  
sufﬁcient to take care of the capital needed to exploit the prospects of the 
next several years. If it is, and if the company is willing to borrow to the 
limit of prudence, the common stock investor need have no concern as to  
the more distant future. If the investor has properly appraised the situation, 
any equity ﬁnancing that might be done some years ahead will be at prices 
so much higher than present levels that he need not be concerned.This is 
because the near-term ﬁnancing will have produced enough increase in 
earnings, by the time still further ﬁnancing is needed some years hence, to 
have brought the stock to a substantially higher price level. 

What to Buy 

7 5 

If  this  borrowing  power  is  not  now  sufﬁcient,  however,  equity 
ﬁnancing becomes necessary. In this case, the attractiveness of the invest-
ment  depends  on  careful  calculations  as  to  how  much  the  dilution 
resulting from the greater number of shares to be outstanding will cut 
into  the  beneﬁts  to  the  present  common  stockholder  that  will  result  
from  the  increased  earnings  this  ﬁnancing  makes  possible. This  equity 
dilution  is  just  as  mathematically  calculable  when  the  dilution  occurs 
through  the  issuance  of  senior  securities  with  conversion  features  as 
when it occurs through the issuance of straight common stock. This is 
because such conversion features are usually exercisable at some moder- 
ate level above the market price at the time of issuance—usually from 
10 to 20 per cent. Since the investor should never be interested in small 
gains of 10 to 20 per cent, but rather in gains which over a period of  
years will be closer to ten or a hundred times this amount, the conver- 
sion price can usually be ignored and the dilution calculated upon the 
basis of complete conversion of the new senior issue. In other words, it 
is well to consider that all senior convertible issues have been convert- 
ed and that all warrants, options, etc., have been exercised when calcu- 
lating the real number of common shares outstanding. 

If equity ﬁnancing will be occurring within several years of the time 
of common stock purchase, and if this equity ﬁnancing will leave com-
mon  stockholders  with  only  a  small  increase  in  subsequent  per-share 
earnings, only one conclusion is justiﬁable. This is that the company has 
a  management  with  sufﬁciently  poor  ﬁnancial  judgment  to  make  the 
common stock undesirable for worthwhile investment. Unless this situ-
ation prevails, the investor need not be deterred by purely ﬁnancial con- 
siderations from going into any situation which, because of its high rat-
ing on the remaining fourteen points covered, gives promise of being 
outstanding. Conversely, from the standpoint of making maximum prof-
its over the years, the investor should never go into a situation with a 
poor score on any of the other fourteen points, merely because of great 
ﬁnancial strength or cash position. 

 14.  Does the management talk freely to investors 
about its affairs when things are going well but “clam 
up” when troubles and disappointments occur?

It is the nature of business that in even the best-run companies unex-
pected difﬁculties, proﬁt squeezes, and unfavorable shifts in demand for 

 
7 6

What to Buy 

7 7 

their  products  will  at  times  occur.  Furthermore,  the  companies  into 
which the investor should be buying if greatest gains are to occur are 
companies which over the years will constantly, through the efforts of 
technical research, be trying to produce and sell new products and new 
processes. By the law of averages, some of these are bound to be costly 
failures. Others will have unexpected delays and heartbreaking expens- 
es  during  the  early  period  of  plant  shake-down.  For  months  on  end, 
such extra and unbudgeted costs will spoil the most carefully laid prof- 
it  forecasts  for  the  business  as  a  whole.  Such  disappointments  are  an 
inevitable part of even the most successful business. If met forthrightly 
and with good judgment, they are merely one of the costs of eventual 
success.They are frequently a sign of strength rather than weakness in a 
company. 

How a management reacts to such matters can be a valuable clue to 
the investor.The management that does not report as freely when things 
are going badly as when they are going well usually “clams up” in this 
way for one of several rather signiﬁcant reasons. It may not have a pro-
gram  worked  out  to  solve  the  unanticipated  difﬁculty.  It  may  have 
become panicky. It may not have an adequate sense of responsibility to 
its stockholders, seeing no reason why it should report more than what 
may seem expedient at the moment. In any event, the investor will do 
well to exclude from investment any company that withholds or tries to 
hide bad news. 

 15.  Does the company have a management of  

unquestionable integrity? 

The management of a company is always far closer to its assets than is  
the  stockholder. Without  breaking  any  laws,  the  number  of  ways  in 
which those in control can beneﬁt themselves and their families at the 
expense  of  the  ordinary  stockholder  is  almost  inﬁnite.  One  way  is  to  
put  themselves—to  say  nothing  of  their  relatives  or  in-laws—on  the 
payroll at salaries far above the normal worth of the work performed. 
Another  is  to  own  properties  they  sell  or  rent  to  the  corporation  at 
above-market rates. Among smaller corporations this is sometimes hard 
to  detect,  since  controlling  families  or  key  ofﬁcers  at  times  buy  and  
lease real estate to such companies, not for purposes of unfair gain but 
in a sincere desire to free limited working capital for other corporate 
purposes.

Another method for insiders to enrich themselves is to get the cor- 
poration’s vendors to sell through certain brokerage ﬁrms which perform  
little if any service for the brokerage commissions involved but which are 
owned  by  these  same  insiders  and  relatives  or  friends.  Probably  most 
costly of all to the investor is the abuse by insiders of their power of issu-
ing common stock options. They can pervert this legitimate method of 
compensating  able  management  by  issuing  to  themselves  amounts  of 
stock far beyond what an unbiased outsider might judge to represent a 
fair reward for services performed. 

There is only one real protection against abuses like these.This is to 
conﬁne  investments  to  companies  the  managements  of  which  have  a 
highly developed sense of trusteeship and moral responsibility to their 
stockholders. This is a point concerning which the “scuttlebutt” method 
can be very helpful. Any investment may still be considered interesting  
if it falls down in regard to almost any other one of the ﬁfteen points 
which  have  now  been  covered,  but  rates  an  unusually  high  score  in 
regard to all the rest. Regardless of how high the rating may be in all 
other  matters,  however,  if  there  is  a  serious  question  of  the  lack  of  a 
strong  management  sense  of  trusteeship  for  stockholders,  the  investor 
should never seriously consider participating in such an enterprise.

What to Buy

Applying This to Your Own Needs

The average investor is not a specialist in the ﬁeld of investment. If a 

man, he usually gives but a tiny fraction of the time or mental effort 
to handling his investments that he devotes to his own work. If a 
woman, the time and effort given to investments is equally small com-
pared to that devoted to her normal duties. The result is that the typical 
investor has usually gathered a good deal of the half-truths, misconcep-
tions, and just plain bunk that the general public has gradually accumu-
lated about successful investing. 

One of the most widespread and least accurate of such ideas is the 
popular conception of what traits are needed to be an investment wizard. 
If  a  public  opinion  poll  were  taken  on  this  subject,  I  suspect  John  Q. 
Public’s composite picture of such an expert would be an introverted, 
bookish individual with an accounting-type mind. This scholastic-like 
investment expert would sit all day in undisturbed isolation poring over 
vast quantities of balance sheets, corporate earning statements, and trade 
statistics.  From  these,  his  superior  intellect  and  deep  understanding  of 
ﬁgures  would  glean  information  not  available  to  the  ordinary  mortal. 
This type of cloistered study would yield invaluable knowledge about 
the location of magniﬁcent investments.

Like so many other widespread misconceptions, this mental picture 
has just enough accuracy to make it highly dangerous for anyone want-
ing to get the greatest long-range beneﬁt from common stocks. 

As already pointed out in the discussion of the ﬁfteen points to be 
considered if a major investment winner is to be selected by any means 
other than pure luck, a few of these matters are largely determined by 
cloistered  mathematical  calculation.  Furthermore,  as  mentioned  near  
the beginning of this book, there is more than one method by which  
an  investor,  if  sufﬁciently  skilled,  can  over  the  years  make  some  
money—occasionally even really worthwhile money—through invest-
ment. The  purpose  of  this  book  is  not  to  point  out  every  way  such  
money can be made. Rather it is to point out the best way. By the best 
way  is  meant  the  greatest  total  proﬁt  for  the  least  risk. The  type  of 
accounting-statistical activity which the general public seems to visual- 
ize as the heart of successful investing will, if enough effort be given it, 
turn up some apparent bargains. Some of these may be real bargains. In 
the case of others there may be such acute business troubles lying ahead, 
yet not discernible from a purely statistical study, that instead of being 
bargains they are actually selling at prices which in a few years will have 
proven to be very high. 

Meanwhile, in the case of even the genuine bargain, the degree by 
which it is undervalued is usually somewhat limited. The time it takes  
to  get  adjusted  to  its  true  value  is  frequently  considerable.  So  far  as  I  
have been able to observe, this means that over a time sufﬁcient to give 
a  fair  comparison—say  ﬁve  years—the  most  skilled  statistical  bargain 
hunter  ends  up  with  a  proﬁt  which  is  but  a  small  part  of  the  proﬁt 
attained by those using reasonable intelligence in appraising the business 
characteristics of superbly managed growth companies. This, of course,  
is  after  charging  the  growth-stock  investor  with  losses  on  ventures  
which did not turn out as expected, and charging the bargain hunter for 
a proportionate amount of bargains that just didn’t turn out. 

The reason why the growth stocks do so much better is that they 
seem to show gains in value in the hundreds of per cent each decade.  
In  contrast,  it  is  an  unusual  bargain  that  is  as  much  as  50  per  cent 
undervalued. The cumulative effect of this simple arithmetic should be 
obvious. 

At  this  point,  the  potential  investor  may  have  to  start  revising  his 
ideas about the amount of time needed to locate the right investments 
for his purpose, to say nothing of the characteristics he must have if he  

What to Buy 

8 1 

is to ﬁnd them. Perhaps he looked forward to spending a few hours each 
week  in  the  comfort  of  his  home,  studying  scads  of  written  material 
which  he  felt  would  unlock  the  door  to  worthwhile  proﬁts.  He  just 
does not have the time to seek out, cultivate, and talk with all the vari-
ous people it might be wise to contact if he wants to handle his com-
mon  stock  investments  to  his  optimum  beneﬁt.  Perhaps  he  does  have 
the time. He still may not have the inclination and personality to seek 
out and chat with a group of people, most of whom he previously had 
not known very well if at all. Furthermore, it is not enough just to chat 
with them; it is necessary to arouse their interest and their conﬁdence 
to a point where they will tell what they know. The successful investor  
is  usually  an  individual  who  is  inherently  interested  in  business  prob-
lems. This results in his discussing such matters in a way that will arouse 
the interest of those from whom he is seeking data. Naturally he must 
have  reasonably  good  judgment  or  all  the  data  he  gets  will  avail  him 
nothing. 

An investor may have the time, inclination, and judgment but still  
be blocked from getting maximum results in the handling of his com-
mon  stocks. The  matter  of  geography  is  also  a  factor. An  investor,  for 
example, living in or near Detroit would have opportunities for learn-
ing about automotive accessory and parts companies that would not be 
available to one equally diligent or able in Oregon. But so many major 
companies  and  industries  are  today  organized  on  a  nation-wide  basis 
with distribution, if not manufacturing, centers in most key cities, that 
investors living in larger industrial centers or their suburbs usually have 
ample  opportunities  to  practice  the  art  of  ﬁnding  at  least  a  few  out- 
standing long-range investments. This unfortunately is not equally true 
for those living in rural areas remote from such centers. 

However, the rural investor or the overwhelming majority of other 
investors who may not have the time, inclination, or ability to uncover 
outstanding  investments  for  themselves  are  by  no  means  barred  from 
making such investments because of this. Actually, the investor’s work is  
so specialized and so intricate that there is no more reason why an indi- 
vidual  should  handle  his  own  investments  than  that  he  should  be  his 
own lawyer, doctor, architect, or automobile mechanic. He should per- 
form these functions if he has special interest in and skill at the partic- 
ular ﬁeld. Otherwise, he deﬁnitely should go to an expert. 

What is important is that he know enough of the principles involved 
so that he can pick a real expert rather than a hack or a charlatan. In some 

 
8 2  

ways it is easier for a careful layman to pick an outstanding investment 
advisor than, say, a comparably superior doctor or lawyer. In other ways 
it  is  much  harder.  It  is  harder  because  the  investment  ﬁeld  has  devel- 
oped much more recently than most comparable specialties. As a result 
mass  ideas  have  not  yet  crystallized  to  the  point  where  there  is  an  
accepted  line  of  demarcation  between  true  knowledge  and  mumbo- 
jumbo. There are not as yet the barriers to weed out the ignorant and 
the  incompetent  in  the  ﬁnancial  ﬁeld  that  exist,  for  example,  in  the  
ﬁelds of law or medicine. Even among some of the so-called authori- 
ties on investment, there is still enough lack of agreement on the basic 
principles involved that it is as yet impossible to have schools for train- 
ing investment experts comparable to the recognized schools for teach- 
ing law or medicine. This makes even more remote the practicability of  
government  authorities  licensing  those  having  the  necessary  back- 
ground of knowledge to guide others in investments in a manner com- 
parable to the way our states license the practicing of law or medicine. 
It is true that many of our states do go through the form of licensing 
investment advisors. However in such instances only known dishonesty 
or ﬁnancial insolvency,  rather  than  a lack of training or skill, provides  
the basis for denying a license. 

All  this  probably  results  in  a  higher  percentage  of  incompetence 
among ﬁnancial advisors than may exist in ﬁelds such as law and med- 
icine.  However,  there  are  compensating  factors  that  can  enable  an 
individual with no personal expertness in investments to pick a capa- 
ble ﬁnancial advisor more easily than a comparably outstanding doctor 
or  lawyer.  Finding  out  which  physician  had  lost  the  smallest  percent- 
age of his practice through deaths would not be a good way to pick a 
superb doctor. Neither would a corresponding box score of cases won 
and lost show the relative skill of attorneys. Fortunately, most medical  
treatments  are  not  matters  of  immediate  life  or  death,  and  a  good  
lawyer will frequently avoid going into litigation at all. 

In the investment advisor’s case it is quite different, however. There 
is  a  score  board  that,  after  enough  time  has  elapsed,  should  pretty  
much  reﬂect  that  advisor’s  investment  skill.  In  occasional  cases  it  may 
take  as  much  as  ﬁve  years  for  investments  to  demonstrate  their  real  
merit.  Usually  it  does  not  take  that  long.  It  would  normally  be  fool-
hardy for anyone to entrust his savings to the skill of a so-called advi-
sor who, working either for himself or others, had less than ﬁve years 
experience. Therefore,  in  the  case  of  investments,  there  is  no  reason  

What to Buy 

8 3 

why those trying to pick a professional advisor should not demand to  
see  a  fair  cross-section  of  results  obtained  for  others.  Those  results, 
compared  to  a  record  of  security  prices  for  the  same  period  of  time,  
give a real clue to the advisor’s ability. 

Two more steps are then necessary before an investor should make 
ﬁnal determination of the individual or organization to which he will 
delegate the important responsibility for his funds. One is the obvious  
step of being certain of that advisor’s complete and unquestioned hon-
esty. The  other  step  is  more  complex.  A  ﬁnancial  advisor  may  have 
obtained far above average results during a period of falling prices not 
because of skill but because he always keeps a large part of the funds he 
manages in, let us say, high-grade bonds. At another time, after a long  
period of rising prices, another advisor may have obtained above-average 
results because of a tendency to go into risky, marginal companies. As 
explained in the discussion of proﬁt margins, such companies usually do  
well  only  in  such  a  period  and  subsequently  do  rather  poorly.  Still  a  
third advisor might do well in both such periods because of a tendency 
to try to guess what the security markets are going to do. This can pro-
duce magniﬁcent results for a while, but is almost impossible to contin- 
ue indeﬁnitely. 

Before selecting an advisor, an investor should learn from that advi-
sor the nature of his basic concept of ﬁnancial management. He should 
then only accept an advisor with concepts fundamentally the same as 
the  investor’s  own.  Naturally,  I  believe  that  the  concepts  expressed  in 
this book are those which fundamentally should govern. Many, reared 
in  the  old-time  ﬁnancial  atmosphere  of  “buy  them  when  they  are  
cheap and sell them when they are high, “would strongly disagree with 
this conclusion. 

Assuming  an  investor  desires  the  type  of  huge,  long-range  gain  
which I believe should be the objective of nearly all common stock pur-
chases, there is one matter which he must decide for himself: whether 
he uses an investment advisor or handles his own affairs. It is a decision 
which must be made because the type of stocks which qualify most sat- 
isfactorily under the previously discussed ﬁfteen points can vary con- 
siderably among themselves in their investment characteristics. 

At one end of the scale are large companies which in spite of out- 
standing  prospects  of  major  further  growth  are  so  ﬁnancially  strong,  
with  roots  going  so  deep  into  the  economic  soil,  that  they  qualify  
under  the  general  classiﬁcation  of  “institutional  stocks.”  This  means  

 
8 4  

that insurance companies, professional trustees, and similar institutional 
buyers will buy them. They will do so because they feel that, while they 
may  misjudge  market  prices  and  could  lose  a  part  of  their  original 
investment should they be forced to sell such stocks at a time of lower 
quotations, they are avoiding the greater danger of loss they could suf- 
fer if they bought into a company that subsequently fell from its pres- 
ent competitive position. 

The Dow Chemical Company, Du Pont, and International Business 
Machines are good examples of this type of growth stock. In Chapter 
One  I  mentioned  the  totally  insigniﬁcant  return  available  from  high-
grade bonds during the ten-year period 1946 to 1956. At the close of 
this period, each of these three stocks—Dow, Du Pont, and IBM—had 
a value approximately ﬁve times what it sold for at the beginning of the 
period.  Nor  during  these  ten  years  did  their  holders  suffer  from  the 
standpoint of current income. Dow, for example, is almost notorious for 
the low rate of return it customarily pays on current market price. Yet 
the investor who bought Dow at the start of this period would at the 
end of it be doing well from the standpoint of current income. Although 
Dow  at  the  time  of  purchase  would  only  have  provided  a  return  of 
about  2½  per  cent  (this  was  a  period  when  yields  on  all  stocks  were  
high),  just  ten  years  later  it  had  increased  dividends  or  split  stock  so  
many  times  that  the  investor  would  have  been  enjoying  a  dividend 
return of between 8 and 9 per cent on the price of his investment ten 
years  earlier.  More  signiﬁcantly,  the  ten-year  period  covered  is  not  an 
unusual one for  companies of  the caliber of these three. Decade after 
decade,  with  only  occasional  interruptions  from  such  one-time  inﬂu-
ences as the great 1929–1932 bear market or World War II, these stocks 
have given almost fabulous performance. 

At the other end of the scale, also of extreme interest for the right 
sort of long-range investment, are small and frequently young compa- 
nies which may only have total sales of from one to six or seven million 
dollars per annum, but which also have products that might bring a sen- 
sational  future. To  qualify  under  the  ﬁfteen  points  already  described,  
such companies will usually have a combination of outstanding business 
management and equally capable scientiﬁc personnel who are pioneer- 
ing in a new or economically promising ﬁeld. The Ampex Corporation 
at the time the stock was ﬁrst offered to the public in 1953 might serve 
as a good example of this type of company. Within four years the value 
of this stock had increased over seven-fold. 

What to Buy 

8 5 

Between these two extremes lie a host of other promising growth 
companies varying all the way from those as young and risky as was Ampex 
in 1953 to those as strong and well entrenched as are Dow, Du Pont, and 
IBM today. Assuming it is time to buy at all (see the next chapter), which 
type should the investor buy? 

The  young  growth  stock  offers  by  far  the  greatest  possibility  of  
gain.  Sometimes  this  can  mount  up  to  several  thousand  per  cent  in  a  
decade.  But  making  at  least  an  occasional  investment  mistake  is  
inevitable  even  for  the  most  skilled  investor.  It  should  never  be  for- 
gotten  that  if  such  a  mistake  is  made  in  this  type  of  common  stock, 
every  dollar  put  into  the  investment  can  be  lost.  In  contrast,  if  the  
stock  is  bought  according  to  the  rules  described  in  the  next  chapter,  
any losses that might occur in the older and more established growth 
stocks  should  be  temporary,  resulting  from  a  period  of  unanticipated 
decline  in  the  stock  market  as  a  whole. The  long-range  gain  in  value 
of this class of big company growth stock will, over the years, be con- 
siderably  less  than  that  of  the  small  and  usually  younger  enterprise. 
Nevertheless  it  will  mount  to  thoroughly  worthwhile  totals.  Even  in  
the  most  conservative  of  the  growth  stocks  it  should  run  to  at  least 
several times the original investment. 

Therefore, for anyone risking a stake big enough to be of real sig- 
niﬁcance  to  himself  or  his  family,  the  rule  to  follow  should  be  rather 
obvious.  It  is  to  put “most”  of  his  funds  into  the  type  of  company  
which, while perhaps not as large as a Dow, a Du Pont, or an Interna- 
tional  Business  Machines,  at  least  comes  closer  to  that  type  of  stock  
than to the small young company. Whether this “most” be 60 per cent  
or 100 per cent of total investments varies with the needs or require-
ments of each individual. A widow with a half million dollars of total 
assets  and  no  children  might  put  all  her  funds  in  the  more  conserva- 
tive  class  of  growth  stocks. Another  widow  with  a  million  dollars  to  
invest  and  three  children  for  whom  she  would  like  to  increase  her 
assets—to  a  degree  that  would  not,  however,  jeopardize  her  scale  of  
living—might  well  put  up  to  15  per  cent  of  her  assets  in  carefully  
selected small young companies. A businessman with a wife, two chil-
dren, a present investment worth $400,000, and an income big enough  
to  save  $10,000  per  annum  after  taxes  might  put  all  his  present  
$400,000 into the more conservative-type growth companies but ven-
ture  the  $10,000  of  new  savings  each  year  on  the  more  risky  half  of  
the investment scale. 

 
8 6  

In all these cases, however, the gain in value over the years of the 
more conservative group of stocks should be enough to outweigh even 
complete loss of all funds put into the more risky type. Meanwhile, if 
properly  selected,  the  more  risky  type  could  signiﬁcantly  increase  the 
total capital gain. Equally important if this happens, these young risky 
companies will by that time have reached a point in their own devel- 
opment where their stocks will no longer be carrying anything like the 
former degree of risk but may even have progressed to a status where 
institutions have begun buying them. 

The problems of the small investor are somewhat more difﬁcult. The 
large  investor  can  often  completely  ignore  the  matter  of  dividend  
returns  in  his  endeavor  to  employ  all  his  funds  in  situations  affording 
maximum growth potential. After his funds are so invested he may still 
obtain from them sufﬁcient dividends either to take care of his desired 
standard of living or to enable him to attain this standard if the dividend  
income is added to his other regular earning power. Most small investors 
cannot  live  on  the  return  on  their  investment  no  matter  how  high  a 
yield  is  obtained,  since  the  total  value  of  their  holdings  is  not  great 
enough. Therefore for the small investor the matter of current dividend 
return usually comes down to a choice between a few hundred dollars 
a year starting right now, or the chance of obtaining an income many 
times this few hundred dollars a year at a later date. 

Before reaching a decision on this crucial point, there is one matter 
which the small investor should face squarely. This is that the only funds 
he should consider using for common stock investment are funds that 
are truly surplus. This does not mean using all funds that remain over  
and  above  what  he  needs  for  everyday  living  expense.  Except  in  the  
most unusual circumstances, he should have a backlog of several thousand 
dollars, sufﬁcient to take care of illnesses or other unexpected contin- 
gencies, before attempting to buy anything with as much intrinsic risk 
as a common stock. Similarly, funds already set aside for some speciﬁc 
future purpose, such as sending a child through college, should never be 
risked in the stock market. It is only after taking care of matters of this 
sort that he should consider common stock investment. 

The  objective  which  the  small  investor  then  has  for  this  surplus 
becomes  somewhat  a  matter  of  personal  choice  and  of  his  particular 
circumstances,  including  the  size  and  nature  of  his  other  income.  A 
young man or woman, or an older investor with children or other heirs 
of  whom  he  or  she  is  particularly  fond,  may  be  willing  to  sacriﬁce  a  

What to Buy 

8 7 

dividend  income  of,  say,  $30  or  $40  a  month  in  order  to  obtain  an 
income ten times that size in ﬁfteen years. In contrast, an elderly per- 
son  with  no  close  heirs  would  naturally  prefer  a  larger  immediate 
income. Similarly, a person earning a relatively small income and with 
heavy  ﬁnancial  obligations  might  have  no  choice  but  to  provide  for 
immediate needs. 

However, for the great majority of small investors, the decision on 
the importance of immediate income is one of personal choice. It prob-
ably is largely dependent on the psychology of each individual investor. 
My  own  purely  personal  view  is  that  a  small  amount  of  additional 
income  (after  taxes)  palls  in  comparison  to  an  investment  that  in  the 
years ahead could bring me a sizable income and, in time, might make 
my children really wealthy. Others may feel quite differently about this. 
It is to the large investor, and to the small investor who feels as I do on 
this  subject  and  desires  an  intelligent  approach  to  the  principles  that  
have made these kinds of results possible, that the procedures set forth in 
this book are presented. 

The success which any particular individual  will have  in  applying 
these principles to his own investments will depend on two things. One 
is the degree of skill with which he applies them. The other is, of course, 
the matter of good fortune. In an age when an unforeseeable discovery 
might happen tomorrow in a research laboratory in no way connected 
with the company in which the investment has been made, and in an  
age  when  ﬁve  years  from  now  that  unrelated  research  development  
could result in either tripling or cutting in half the proﬁts of this invest-
ment, good fortune obviously can play a tremendous part so far as any  
one  investment  is  concerned.  This  is  why  even  the  medium-sized 
investor has an advantage over those of very small means. This element 
of good or bad fortune will largely average out if several well-selected 
investments are chosen.

However, for both large and small investors who prefer far greater 
income some years from now to maximum possible return today, it is 
well to remember that during the past thirty-ﬁve years numerous stud-
ies  have  been  made  by  various  ﬁnancial  authorities. These  have  com-
pared the results obtained from the purchase of common stocks which 
afford a high dividend yield with those obtained from the purchase of 
low-yield  stocks  of  companies  that  have  concentrated  on  growth  and 
the reinvestment of assets. As far as I know, every one of these studies  
has shown the same trend. The growth stocks, over a ﬁve- or ten-year 

 
8 8  

span, have proven spectacularly better so far as their increase in capital 
value is concerned. 

More surprising, in the same time span such stocks have usually so 
increased their dividends that, while still paying a low return in relation 
to the enhanced value at which they were by then selling, they were by 
this  time  paying  a  greater  dividend  return  on  the  original  investment 
than were the stocks selected for yield alone. In other words, the growth 
stocks had not only shown a marked superiority in the ﬁeld of capital 
appreciation,  but  given  a  reasonable  time,  they  had  grown  to  a  point 
where they showed superiority in the matter of dividend return as well.

When to Buy

The preceding chapters attempted to show that the heart of succes- 

sful investing is knowing how to ﬁnd the minority of stocks that in 
the years ahead will have spectacular growth in their per-share earn-
ings. Therefore, is there any reason to divert time or mental effort from 
the main issue? Does not the matter of when to buy become of rela-
tively  minor  importance?  Once  the  investor  is  sure  he  has  deﬁnitely 
found an outstanding stock, isn’t any time at all a good time to buy it? 
The answer to this depends somewhat on the investor’s objective. It also 
depends on his temperament. 

Let us take an example. With the ease of hindsight it can be made the 
most extreme example in modern ﬁnancial history. This would be the 
purchase of several superbly selected enterprises in the summer of 1929  
or just before the greatest stock market crash of American history. In time 
such a purchase would have turned out well. But twenty-ﬁve years later 
it would provide a much smaller percentage gain than would have been 
the case if, having done the hardest part of the job in selecting his com-
panies properly, an investor had made the small extra effort needed to 
understand a few simple principles about the timing of growth stocks. 

In other words, if the right stocks are bought and held long enough 
they will always produce some proﬁt. Usually they will produce a hand-
some proﬁt. However, to produce close to the maximum proﬁt, the kind 
of spectacular proﬁt deﬁned earlier, some consideration must be given 
to timing. 

The conventional method of timing when to buy stocks is, I believe, 
just as silly as it appears on the surface to be sensible. This method is to

marshal a vast mass of economic data. From these data conclusions are 
reached  as  to  the  near-  and  medium-term  course  of  general  business. 
More sophisticated investors will usually form opinions about the future 
course of money rates as well as business activity. Then, if their forecasts 
for all these matters indicate no major worsening of background condi- 
tions, the conclusion is that the desired stock may be bought. It some-
times appears that dark clouds are forming on the horizon. Then those 
who use this generally accepted method will postpone or cancel pur-
chases they otherwise would make. 

My objection to this approach is not that it is unreasonable in the- 
ory. It is that in the current state of human knowledge about the eco- 
nomics which deal with forecasting future business trends, it is impos-
sible to apply this method in practice. The chances of being right are  
not  good  enough  to  warrant  such  methods  being  used  as  a  basis  for 
risking  the  investment  of  savings. This  may  not  always  be  the  case.  It  
might not even be the case ﬁve or ten years from now. At present, able  
men  are  attempting  to  harness  electronic  computers  to  establish 
“input-output” series of sufﬁcient intricacy that perhaps at some future 
date  it  may  be  possible  to  know  with  a  fair  degree  of  precision  what  
the coming business trends will be. 

When, if ever, such developments occur, the art of common stock 
investment may have to be radically revised. Until they occur, however, 
I believe that the economics which deal with forecasting business trends 
may be considered to be about as far along as was the science of chem- 
istry during the days of alchemy in the Middle Ages. In chemistry then, 
as  in  business  forecasting  now,  basic  principles  were  just  beginning  to 
emerge from a mysterious mass of mumbo-jumbo. However, chemistry 
had not reached a point where such principles could be safely used as a 
basis for choosing a course of action. 

Occasionally, as in 1929, the economy gets so out of line that spec- 
ulative  enthusiasm  for  the  future  runs  to  unprecedented  proportions. 
Even in our present state of economic ignorance, it is possible to make  
a pretty accurate guess as to what will occur. However, I doubt if the 
years when it is safe to do this have averaged much more than one out 
of ten. They may be even rarer in the future. 

The typical investor is so used to having economic forecasts made 
for him that he may start by trusting too strongly the dependability of 
such forecasts. If so, I suggest that he look over a ﬁle of the back issues 
of the Commercial & Financial Chronicle for any year he may choose since 

When to Buy 

9 1 

the end of World War II. As a matter of fact it might pay him to look  
over such a ﬁle even though he is aware of the fallibility of these fore-
casts. Regardless of the year he selects he will ﬁnd, among other mate- 
rial, a sizable number of articles in which leading economic and ﬁnan-
cial  authorities  give  their  views  of  the  outlook  for  the  period  ahead. 
Since the editors of this journal appear to select their material so as to 
give the ablest available presentations of both optimistic and pessimistic 
opinions, it is not surprising that opposing forecasts will be found in any 
such series of back issues. What is surprising is the degree by which such 
experts disagree with each other. Even more surprising is how strong 
and convincing some of the arguments were bound to seem at the time 
they were written. This is particularly true of some of the forecasts that 
turned out to be most wrong. 

The  amount  of  mental  effort  the  ﬁnancial  community  puts  into 
this  constant  attempt  to  guess  the  economic  future  from  a  random  
and  probably  incomplete  series  of  facts  makes  one  wonder  what  
might have been accomplished if only a fraction of such mental effort 
had  been  applied  to  something  with  a  better  chance  of  proving  use- 
ful.  I  have  already  compared  economic  forecasting  with  chemistry  in  
the  days  of  alchemy.  Perhaps  this  preoccupation  with  trying  to  do 
something  which  apparently  cannot  yet  be  done  properly  permits 
another comparison with the Middle Ages. 

That was a period when most of the Western world lived in an envi- 
ronment  of  unnecessary  want  and  human  suffering. This  was  largely 
because  the  considerable  mental  ability  of  the  period  was  devoted  to 
fruitless results. Consider what might have been accomplished if half as 
much thought had been given to ﬁghting hunger, disease, and greed as 
was devoted to debating such points as the number of angels that could 
balance on the head of a pin. Perhaps just part of the collective intelli- 
gence  nowadays  employed  in  the  investment  community’s  attempt  to 
guess the future trend of the business cycle could produce spectacular 
results if it were harnessed to more productive purposes. 

If, then, conventional studies of the near-term economic prospect  
do not provide the right method of approach to the proper timing of 
buying,  what  does  provide  it? The  answer  lies  in  the  very  nature  of 
growth stocks themselves. 

At the risk of being repetitious, let us review for a moment some of 
the  basic  characteristics  of  outstandingly  desirable  investments,  as  dis-
cussed in the preceding chapter. These companies are usually working  

 
9 2  

in  one  way  or  another  on  the  very  frontiers  of  scientiﬁc  technology.  
They are developing various new products or processes from the labo- 
ratory  through  the  pilot  plant  to  the  early  stages  of  commercial  pro- 
duction. All of this costs money in varying amounts. All of it is a drain 
on other proﬁts of the business. Even in the early stage of commercial 
production the extra sales expense involved in building sufﬁcient vol-
ume for a new product to furnish the desired margin of proﬁt is such 
that the out-of-pocket losses at this stage of development may be greater 
than they were during the pilot-plant period. 

From the standpoint of the investor there are two aspects of all this 
that  have  particular  signiﬁcance.  One  of  these  is  the  impossibility  of 
depending on any sure time table in the development cycle of a new 
product. The other is that even for the most brilliantly-managed enter-
prises, a percentage of failures is part of the cost of doing business. In a 
sport, such as baseball, even the most outstanding league champions will 
have dropped some percentage of their scheduled games. 

The  point  in  the  development  of  a  new  process  that  is  perhaps 
worth the closest scrutiny from the standpoint of timing the buying of 
common stocks is that at which the ﬁrst full-scale commercial plant is 
about to begin production. In a new plant for even established proces- 
ses or products, there will probably be a shake-down period of six to 
eight weeks that will prove rather expensive. It takes this long to get the 
equipment  adjusted  to  the  required  operating  efﬁciency  and  to  weed 
out  the  inevitable “bugs”  that  seem  to  occur  in  breaking  in  modern 
intricate machinery. When the process is really revolutionary, this expen- 
sive shake-down period may extend far beyond the estimate of even the 
most pessimistic company engineer. Furthermore, when problems ﬁnal- 
ly  do  get  solved,  the  weary  stockholder  still  cannot  look  forward  to 
immediate  proﬁts. There  are  more  months  of  still  further  drain  while 
even more of the company’s proﬁts from older lines are being ploughed 
back  into  special  sales  and  advertising  efforts  to  get  the  new  product 
accepted. 

It  may  be  that  the  company  making  all  this  effort  is  having  such 
growth in revenue from other and older products that the drain on prof- 
its is not noticed by the average stockholder. Frequently, however, just 
the  opposite  happens. As  word  ﬁrst  gets  out  about  a  spectacular  new 
product in the laboratory of a well-run company, eager buyers bid up 
the  price  of  that  company’s  shares. When  word  comes  of  successful  
pilot-plant  operation,  the  shares  go  still  higher.  Few  think  of  the  old 

When to Buy 

9 3 

analogy that operating a pilot plant is like driving an automobile over a 
winding  country  road  at  ten  miles  per  hour.  Running  a  commercial 
plant is like driving on that same road at 100 miles per hour. 

Then when month after month difﬁculties crop up in getting the 
commercial  plant  started,  these  unexpected  expenses  cause  per-share 
earnings  to  dip  noticeably. Word  spreads  that  the  plant  is  in  trouble. 
Nobody can guarantee when, if ever, the problems will be solved. The 
former  eager  buyers  of  the  stock  become  discouraged  sellers.  Down  
goes the price of the stock. The longer the shake-down lasts the more 
market  quotations  sag. At  last  comes  the  good  news  that  the  plant  is 
ﬁnally  running  smoothly. A  two-day  rally  occurs  in  the  price  of  the 
stock.  However,  in  the  following  quarter  when  special  sales  expenses 
have caused a still further sag in net income, the stock falls to the low- 
est price in years.Word passes all through the ﬁnancial community that 
the management has blundered. 

At this point the stock might well prove a sensational buy. Once the 
extra sales effort has produced enough volume to make the ﬁrst pro- 
duction scale plant pay, normal sales effort is frequently enough to con-
tinue the upward movement of the sales curve for many years. Since the 
same  techniques  are  used,  the  placing  in  operation  of  a  second,  third, 
fourth, and ﬁfth plant can nearly always be done without the delays and 
special expenses that occurred during the prolonged shake-down peri- 
od of the ﬁrst plant. By the time plant Number Five is running at capac-
ity, the company has grown so big and prosperous that the whole cycle 
can be repeated on another brand new product without the same drain 
on earnings percentage-wise or the same downward effect on the price 
of the company’s shares. The investor has acquired at the right time an 
investment which can grow for him for many years. 

In the original edition I then used the following words to describe 
an example of this type of opportunity. I used an example that was still 
fairly recent at that time. I said: 

“Immediately  prior  to  the  1954  congressional  elections,  certain 
investment  funds  took  advantage  of  this  type  of  situation.  For  several 
years before this time, American Cyanamid shares had sold in the mar-
ket at a considerably lower price-earnings ratio than most of the other 
major chemical companies. I believe this was because the general feel- 
ing  in  the  ﬁnancial  community  was  that,  while  the  Lederle  division 
represented  one  of  the  world’s  most  outstanding  pharmaceutical  

 
9 4  

organizations,  the  relatively  larger  industrial  and  agricultural  chemical  
activities  constituted  a  hodge-podge  of  expensive  and  inefﬁcient  
plants ﬂung together in the typical ‘stock market’ merger period of the 
booming  1920’s. These  properties  were  generally  considered  anything 
but a desirable investment. 

“Largely unnoticed was the fact that a new management was steadi- 
ly but without fanfare cutting production costs, eliminating dead wood, 
and streamlining the organization. What was noticed was that this com-
pany was ‘making a huge bet’—making a major capital expenditure, for 
a  company  its  size,  in  a  giant  new  organic  chemical  plant  at  Fortier, 
Louisiana. So much complex engineering was designed into this plant 
that  it  should  have  surprised  no  one  when  the  plant  lagged  many 
months behind schedule in reaching the break-even point. As the prob-
lems at Fortier continued, however, the situation added to the general- 
ly  unfavorable  light  in  which American  Cyanamid  shares  were  then 
being regarded. At this stage, in the belief a buying point was at hand, 
the funds to which I have already referred acquired their holdings at an 
average  price  of  45¾. This  would  be  227
8  on  the  present  shares  as  a  
result of a 2-for-l stock split which occurred in 1957. 

“What has happened since? Sufﬁcient time has elapsed for the com-
pany to begin getting the beneﬁts of some of the management activities 
that were creating abnormal costs in 1954. Fortier is now proﬁtable. Earn- 
ings have increased from $1.48 per (present) common share in 1954 to 
$2.10 per share in 1956 and promise to be slightly higher in 1957, a year 
in which most chemical (though not pharmaceutical) proﬁts have run 
behind those of the year before. At least as important, ‘Wall Street’ has 
come  to  realize  that American  Cyanamid’s  industrial  and  agricultural 
chemical activities are worthy of institutional investment. As a result, the 
price-earnings ratio of these shares has changed noticeably. A 37 per cent 
increase in earnings that has taken place in somewhat under three years 
has produced a gain in market value of approximately 85 per cent.” 

Since writing these words, the ﬁnancial community’s steady upgrad-
ing of the status of American Cyanamid appears to have continued. With 
earnings for 1959 promising to top the previous all-time peak of $2.42 
in 1957, the market price of these shares has steadily advanced. It now  
is about 60, representing a gain of about 70 per cent in earning power 
and  163  per  cent  in  market  value  in  the  ﬁve  years  since  the  shares  
referred to in the ﬁrst edition were acquired. 

When to Buy

I would like to end the discussion of American Cyanamid on this 
happy  note.  However,  in  the  preface  to  this  revised  edition  I  stated  I 
intended to make this revision an honest record and not the most favor-
able sounding record it might appear plausible to present. You may have 
noticed that in the original edition I referred to this 1954 purchase of 
Cyanamid stock by “certain funds”; these funds are no longer retaining 
the shares, which were sold in the spring of 1959 at an average price of 
about 49. This was of course signiﬁcantly below the current market but 
still represented a proﬁt of about 110 per cent. 

The size of the proﬁt had nothing whatsoever to do with the deci-
sion to sell. There were two motives behind this decision. One was that 
the long-range outlook for another company appeared even better. You 
will ﬁnd this discussed in the next chapter as one of the valid reasons  
for  selling. While  not  enough  time  has  yet  passed  to  give  conclusive 
proof one way or the other, so far comparative market quotations for 
both stocks appear to have warranted this move. 

However, there was a second motive behind this switch of invest-
ments which hindsight may prove to be less creditable. This was concern 
that in relation to the most outstanding of competitive companies, Amer- 
ican Cyanamid’s chemical (in contrast to its pharmaceutical) business was 
not making as much progress in broadening proﬁt margins and estab- 
lishing proﬁtable new lines as had been hoped. Concern over these fac- 
tors was accentuated by uncertainty over the possible costs of the com- 
pany’s attempt to establish itself in the acrylic ﬁber business in the highly 
competitive textile industry. This reasoning may prove to be correct and 
still could turn out to have been the wrong investment decision, because 
of  bright  prospects  in  the  Lederle,  or  pharmaceutical,  division. These 
prospects have become more apparent since the shares were sold. The 
possibilities for a further sharp jump in Lederle earning power in the 
medium-term future center around 1) a new and quite promising antibi- 
otic, and 2) in time a sizable market for an oral “live” polio vaccine, a ﬁeld 
in which this company has been a leader. These developments make it 
problematic and a matter that only the future will decide as to whether 
this decision to dispose of Cyanamid shares may not have been an invest-
ment  mistake.  Because  studying  possible  mistakes  can  be  even  more 
rewarding than reviewing past successes, I am going to suggest—even at 
the risk of appearing presumptuous—that anyone seriously interested in 
bettering his investment technique mark these last several paragraphs and 
reread them after having read the coming chapter on “When to Sell.” 

 
9 6  

Now let me turn to the next and more recent example of this type 
of purchasing opportunity which I cited in the original edition. I said: 

“A somewhat similar situation may be occurring in the second half 
of 1957 in the case of the Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. 
A few large institutional buyers have liked these shares for some time. 
Many  more,  however,  seem  to  feel  that  in  spite  of  some  elements  of 
interest they want evidence concerning certain matters before acquir-
ing shares. To understand this attitude it is necessary to go into some of 
the background. 

“Prior to World War II this company had conﬁned its activities to a 
diversiﬁed line of machinery manufacture. As a result of brilliant man- 
agement  and  equally  brilliant  developmental  engineering,  Food 
Machinery had become one of the spectacularly successful investments 
of the prewar period. Then during the war, in addition to going into the 
related line of ordnance manufacture at which the company has been 
comparably successful, the company built up a diversiﬁed chemical busi-
ness. Reason for this was a desire to stabilize the cyclical tendency of the 
machinery business through the manufacture of consumable products, 
sales of which over the years could be continuously expanded through 
research in much the same manner as had been so successfully exploited 
in the machinery and ordnance divisions. 

“By  1952,  four  separate  companies  had  been  acquired  and  were 
converted  into  four  (now  ﬁve)  divisions.  Combined  they  represent 
slightly  less  than  half  the  total  sales  volume  if  ordnance  activities  are 
included, slightly more than half if only the normal non-defense activ-
ities  are  considered.  Before  and  in  the  early  acquisition  years,  these 
chemical units varied enormously. One was a leader in a rapidly grow-
ing ﬁeld with broad proﬁt margins and excellent technical prestige in 
the  industry. Another  suffered  from  obsolete  plant,  low  margins,  and 
poor morale.The average of all left much to be desired in comparison 
with the real leaders among chemical companies. In some cases there 
were intermediate products without basic raw materials. In others, there 
were plenty of low-proﬁt raw materials, but few products with higher 
proﬁt margins that could be built from these raw materials. 

“The  ﬁnancial  community  reached  some  pretty  deﬁnite  conclu- 
sions on all this. The machinery divisions—with an internal growth rate 
of 9 to 10 per cent per annum (comparable to the chemical industry  
as  a  whole),  with  a  demonstrated  ability  to  design  and  sell  ingenious  

When to Buy 

9 7 

and  commercially  worthwhile  new  products  year  after  year,  and  with 
some  of  the  lowest  cost  plants  in  their  respective  ﬁelds—represented 
the  highest  grade  investment.  However,  until  the  chemical  divisions 
could demonstrate broader over-all proﬁt margins and other evidence 
of  intrinsic  quality,  there  was  little  desire  to  invest  in  this  combined 
enterprise. 

“Meanwhile,  the  management  went  aggressively  to  work  to  solve  
this problem. What did they do? Their ﬁrst move was through internal 
promotions  and  external  recruitments  to  build  up  a  top  management 
team. This new team spent money on modernizing old plant, develop- 
ing new plant, and on research. Entirely aside from plant expenditures 
that  are  normally  capitalized,  it  is  impossible  to  undergo  major  mod- 
ernization and plant expansion without running up current expenses as 
well. It is rather surprising that all the abnormal expenses that occurred 
in 1955, 1956, and 1957 did not cause reported chemical earnings to 
decline  during  that  period. The  fact  that  earnings  held  steady  gives 
strong indication of the worth of what had already been done. 

“In any event, if projects have been properly planned, the cumula- 
tive effect of those already completed must in time outweigh the abnor-
mal expense of those still to come. Something of this sort might have 
happened as far back as 1956 if research expenditures in that year had 
not been increased about 50 per cent above the 1955 levels. This was 
done  even  though  in  1955  these  expenditures  for  chemical  research 
were not far below the average of the industry, and those for machinery 
research were well above that of most segments of the machinery busi-
ness. In spite of continuing this higher level of research, such an earning  
spurt was expected in the second half of 1957. At midyear the company’s 
modernized  chlorine  cells  at  South  Charleston,  West Virginia,  were 
scheduled  to  go  on  stream.  Unexpected  troubles,  characteristic  of  the 
chemical industry but from which this company had been surprisingly 
free in most of its other modernization and expansion programs, indi-
cate that it will be the ﬁrst quarter of 1958 before this earning spurt will 
now occur. 

“I  suspect  that  until  this  earning  betterment  comes  and  chemical 
proﬁt margins grow and continue to broaden for a period of time, the 
institutional buyer will generally fail to look beneath the surface and will 
largely stay away from this stock. If, as I suspect will happen, such a devel-
opment manifests itself in 1958 and 1959, ﬁnancial sentiment some time 
in that period will come around to recognizing the basic improvement 

 
9 8  

in  fundamentals  that  started  several  years  before.  At  that  time  the  
stock, which may then continue to grow for years, will be selling at a 
price that has advanced partly because of the improvement in per-share  
earnings  that  had  already  occurred  but  even  more  because  of  the 
changed  price-earnings  ratio  that  results  from  a  general  reappraisal  of 
the company’s intrinsic quality.” 

I  believe  the  record  of  the  past  two  years  emphatically  validates  
these comments. Possibly the ﬁrst general recognition of what had been 
happening beneath the surface came when in the depression-like year  
of  1958,  a  year  when  nearly  all  chemical  and  machinery  companies 
showed  a  decided  drop  in  earning  power,  Food  Machinery  reported 
proﬁts at an all-time peak of $2.39 per share. This was moderately above 
the levels of the several preceding years when the general economy was 
at higher levels. It was a tip-off that the chemical divisions were at last 
being brought to a point where they could take their place along with 
the machinery end of the business as a highly desirable and not a mar-
ginal investment.While 1959 proﬁts are not yet available as these words 
are written, the sharp gains in earning power reported for the ﬁrst nine 
months over the corresponding period of 1958 give further assurance 
that the long period of reorganizing the chemical divisions is bearing 
rich fruit. The 1959 gains are perhaps particularly signiﬁcant in that this 
is the year in which the ordnance division is in transition from its for-
mer  principal  product  of  an  armored  personnel  and  light  equipment 
amphibious tank-like carrier made of steel, to an aluminum one that can 
be dropped from the air by parachute. This means that 1959 was the one 
year in the recent past or foreseeable future in which ordnance activi- 
ties  made  no  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  total  earning  power. Yet  an 
important new earning peak was attainted. 

How is the market responding to all this? At the end of September 
1957, when writing of the ﬁrst edition was concluded, these shares were 
selling at 25¼. Today they are at 51, a gain of 102 per cent. It is begin-
ning to look as though the ﬁnancial sentiment I mentioned in the orig- 
inal edition is beginning “to recognize the basic improvement in funda- 
mentals that started some years before.” 

Other events are conﬁrming this trend and may give further impetus 
to it. In 1959 the McGraw-Hill Publications inaugurated a new custom. 
They decided each year to give an award for outstanding management 
achievement in the chemical industries. To determine the ﬁrst winner  

When to Buy 

9 9 

of  this  honor  they  selected  an  unusually  distinguished  and  informed 
panel  of  ten  members.  Four  represented  leading  university  graduate 
schools  of  business  administration,  three  came  from  major  investment 
institutions  with  heavy  holdings  in  the  chemical  industry,  and  three  
were leading members of prominent chemical consulting ﬁrms. Twenty- 
two companies were nominated and fourteen submitted presentations. 
This  award  for  management  accomplishment  did  not  go  to  one  or 
another  of  the  giants  of  the  industry,  the  managements  of  several  of  
which,  with  very  good  reason,  are  highly  respected  in  Wall  Street.  
Instead  it  went  to  the  Chemical  Divisions  of  the  Food  Machinery 
Corporation which, two years before, had been regarded by most and is 
still regarded by many institutional stock buyers as a rather undesirable 
investment! 

Why  is  a  matter  of  this  sort  of  major  importance  to  long-range 
investors? First, it gives strong assurance that, plus or minus the trend of 
general business activity, the earnings of such a company will grow for 
years to come. Informed chemical businessmen would not give this kind 
of award in the industry to a company that did not have the research 
departments to keep developing worthwhile new products and the chem- 
ical engineers to produce them proﬁtably. Secondly, this type of award will 
leave its impression on the investment community. Nothing is more desir- 
able for stockholders than the inﬂuence on share prices of an upward 
trend of earnings multiplied by a comparable upward trend in the way 
each dollar of such earnings is valued in the market place, as I mentioned 
in my concluding remarks about this company in the original edition. 

Other  matters  besides  the  introduction  of  new  products  and  the 
problems of starting complex plants can also open up buying opportu- 
nities in the unusual company. For example, a Middle Western electronic 
company  was,  among  other  things,  well  known  for  its  unusual  and 
excellent  labor  relations.  It  grew  to  a  point  where  size  alone  forced 
some  change  in  its  method  of  handling  employees.  An  unfortunate 
interplay  of  personalities  caused  friction,  slow-down  strikes,  and  low 
productivity in an enterprise heretofore known for its good labor rela-
tions and high labor productivity. At just this time the company made 
one of the very few mistakes it has made in judging the potential mar-
ket for a new product. Earnings dropped precipitously and so did the 
price of the shares. 

The unusually able and ingenious management made plans at once 
to correct this situation. While plans can be made in a matter of weeks, 

 
1 0 0  

putting them into effect takes much longer. As results from these plans 
began  coming  through  to  earnings,  the  stock  reached  what  might  be 
called buying point A. However, it took about a year and a half before all 
the beneﬁts could ﬂow through to the proﬁt statement. Toward the end 
of this period a second strike occurred, settlement of which was the last 
step  needed  to  enable  the  company  to  restore  competitive  efﬁciency. 
This strike was not a long one. Nevertheless, while this short and rela-
tively inexpensive strike was occurring, word went through the ﬁnan-
cial  community  that  labor  matters  were  going  from  bad  to  worse.  In 
spite  of  heavy  buying  from  ofﬁcers  of  the  company,  the  stock  went 
lower. It did not stay lower for long. This proved to be another of the 
right sort of buying opportunities from the standpoint of timing, and 
might be called buying point B. Those who looked beneath the surface 
and saw what was really happening were able to buy, at bargain prices,  
a stock that may well grow for them for many years. 

Let us see just how proﬁtable it might have been if an investor had 
bought at either buying point A or buying point B. I do not intend to 
use the lowest price which a table of monthly price ranges would show 
that this stock reached in either period. This is because only a few hun-
dred shares changed hands at the extreme low point. If an investor had 
bought at the absolute lows, it would have been more a matter of luck 
than anything else. Instead, I will use a ﬁgure moderately above the low 
in  one  case  and  several  points  above  in  the  other.  In  each  instance  a  
good many thousand shares were available and changed hands at these 
levels. I will use only prices at which the shares could easily have been 
bought by anyone making a realistic study of the situation. 

At buying point A the stock had slipped in  just a  few months  by 
about 24 per cent from its former peak. Within about a year those who 
bought here would have had a gain in market value of between 55 per 
cent and 60 per cent. Then came the strike that produced buying point 
B. The  stock  dropped  back  almost  20  per  cent.  Strangely  enough,  it 
remained  there  for  some  weeks  after  the  strike  ended. At  this  time,  a 
brilliant employee of a large investment trust explained to me that he 
knew how good the situation was and what was almost sure to happen. 
Nevertheless  he  would  not  recommend  the  purchase  to  his  ﬁnancial 
committee.  He  said  certain  of  the  members  were  sure  to  check  with 
Wall Street friends and not only turn down his recommendation, but 
rebuke  him  for  bringing  to  their  attention  a  company  with  a  sloppy 
management and hopeless labor relations! 

When to Buy 

1 0 1 

As  I  write  this  not  so  many  months  later,  the  stock  has  already  
risen  50  per  cent  from  buying  point  B. This  means  that  it  is  now  up  
over 90 per cent from buying point A. More important, the company’s 
future  looks  brilliant,  with  every  prospect  that  it  will  enjoy  abnormal 
growth for years to come just as it did for some years before the com- 
bination of unusual and temporary unfortunate occurrences produced 
buying points A and B. Those who bought at either time got into the 
right sort of company at the right sort of time. 

In short, the company into which the investor should be buying is 
the company which is doing things under the guidance of exceptional- 
ly able management. A few of these things are bound to fail. Others will 
from  time  to  time  produce  unexpected  troubles  before  they  succeed. 
The  investor  should  be  thoroughly  sure  in  his  own  mind  that  these 
troubles  are  temporary  rather  than  permanent. Then  if  these  troubles 
have produced a signiﬁcant decline in the price of the affected stock and 
give promise of being solved in a matter of months rather than years, he 
will probably be on pretty safe ground in considering that this is a time 
when the stock may be bought. 

All buying points do not arise out of corporate troubles. In indus-
tries  such  as  chemical  production,  where  large  amounts  of  capital  are 
required for each dollar of sales, another type of opportunity sometimes 
occurs. The mathematics of such situations are usually about like this: A 
new plant or plants will be erected for, say, $10 million. A year or two 
after  these  plants  are  in  full-scale  operation,  the  company’s  engineers  
will go over them in detail. They will come up with proposals for spend-
ing an additional, say, $1½ million. For this 15 per cent greater total cap-
ital investment the engineers will show how the output of the plants can 
be increased by perhaps 40 per cent of previous capacity. 

Obviously,  since  the  plants  are  already  proﬁtable  and  40  per  cent 
more output can be made and sold for only 15 per cent more capital 
cost,  and  since  almost  no  additional  general  overhead  is  involved,  the 
proﬁt  margin  on  this  extra  40  per  cent  of  output  will  be  unusually 
good. If the project is large enough to affect the company’s earnings as 
a whole, buying the company’s shares just before this improvement in 
earning power has been reﬂected in the market price for these shares 
can similarly mean a chance to get into the right sort of company at the 
right time. 

What  is  the  common  denominator  of  each  of  the  examples  just 
given? It is that a worthwhile improvement in earnings is coming in the 

 
1 0 2  

right sort of company, but that this particular increase in earnings has  
not yet produced an upward move in the price of that company’s shares. 
I believe that whenever this situation occurs the right sort of investment 
may be considered to be in a buying range. Conversely, when it does not 
occur, an investor will still in the long run make money if he buys into 
outstanding companies. However, he had then better have a somewhat  
greater  degree  of  patience  for  it  will  take  him  longer  to  make  this  
money and percentage-wise it will be a considerably smaller proﬁt on 
his original investment. 

Does this mean that if a person has some money to invest he should 
completely ignore what the future trend of the business cycle may be 
and invest 100 per cent of this fund the moment he has found the right 
stocks, as deﬁned in Chapter Three, and located a good buying point, as 
indicated  in  this  chapter? A  depression  might  strike  right  after  he  has 
made his investment. Since a decline of 40 to 50 per cent from its peak 
is  not  at  all  uncommon  for  even  the  best  stock  in  a  normal  business 
depression, is not completely ignoring the business cycle rather a risky 
policy? 

I think this risk may be taken in stride by the investor who, for a con- 
siderable period of time, has already had the bulk of his stocks placed in 
well-chosen  situations.  If  properly  chosen,  these  should  by  now  have 
already shown him some fairly substantial capital gains. But now, either 
because he believes one of his securities should be sold or because some 
new funds have come his way, such an investor has funds to purchase 
something new. Unless it is one of those rare years when speculative buy- 
ing is running riot in the stock market and major economic storm signals 
are virtually screaming their warnings (as happened in 1928 and 1929), I 
believe this class of investor should ignore any guesses on the coming  
trend of general business or the stock market. Instead he should invest the 
appropriate funds as soon as the suitable buying opportunity arises. 

In  contrast  to  guessing  which  way  general  business  or  the  stock 
market may go, he should be able to judge with only a small probabili- 
ty of error what the company into which he wants to buy is going to 
do  in  relation  to  business  in  general. Therefore  he  starts  off  with  two 
advantages. He is making his bet upon something which he knows to  
be the case, rather than upon something about which he is largely guess-
ing. Furthermore, since by deﬁnition he is only buying into a situation 
which for one reason or another is about to have a worthwhile increase 
in  its  earning  power  in  the  near-  or  medium-term  future,  he  has  a 

When to Buy 

1 0 3 

second element of support. Just as his stock would have risen more than  
the average stock when this new source of earning power became rec- 
ognized in the market place if business had remained good, so if by bad 
fortune  he  has  made  his  new  purchase  just  prior  to  a  general  market 
break this same new source of earnings should prevent these shares from 
declining quite as much as other stocks of the same general type. 

However, many investors are not in the happy position of having a 
backlog of well-chosen investments bought comfortably below present 
prices. Perhaps this may be the ﬁrst time they have funds to invest. Per- 
haps they may have a portfolio of bonds or relatively static non-growth 
stocks which at long last they desire to convert into shares that in the 
future will show them more worthwhile gains. If such investors get pos- 
session  of  new  funds  or  develop  a  desire  to  convert  to  growth  stocks  
after  a  prolonged  period  of  prosperity  and  many  years  of  rising  stock 
prices, should they, too, ignore the hazards of a possible business depres-
sion? Such an investor would not be in a very happy position if, later  
on, he realized he had committed all or most of his assets near the top  
of a long rise or just prior to a major decline. 

This does create a problem. However, the solution to this problem  
is not especially difﬁcult—as in so many other things connected with 
the  stock  market  it  just  requires  an  extra  bit  of  patience.  I  believe  
investors  in  this  group  should  start  buying  the  appropriate  type  of 
common stocks just as soon as they feel sure they have located one or 
more  of  them.  However,  having  made  a  start  in  this  type  of  purchas- 
ing,  they  should  stagger  the  timing  of  further  buying. They  should  
plan to allow several years before the ﬁnal part of their available funds 
will  have  become  invested.  By  so  doing,  if  the  market  has  a  severe  
decline  somewhere  in  this  period,  they  will  still  have  purchasing  
power  available  to  take  advantage  of  such  a  decline.  If  no  decline  
occurs  and  they  have  properly  selected  their  earlier  purchases,  they 
should  have  at  least  a  few  substantial  gains  on  such  holdings.  This 
would provide a cushion so that if a severe decline happened to occur 
at  the  worst  possible  time  for  them—which  would  be  just  after  the 
ﬁnal  part  of  their  funds  had  become  fully  invested—the  gains  on  the 
earlier  purchases  should  largely,  if  not  entirely,  offset  the  declines  on  
the  more  recent  ones.  No  severe  loss  of  original  capital  would  there- 
fore be involved. 

There is an equally important reason why investors who have not 
already  obtained  a  record  of  satisfactory  investments,  and  who  have 

 
1 0 4  

enough funds to be able to stagger their purchases should do so. This is 
that  such  investors  will  have  had  a  practical  demonstration,  prior  to  
using up all their funds, that they or their advisors are sufﬁcient masters 
of  investment  technique  to  operate  with  reasonable  efﬁciency.  In  the 
event that such a record had not been attained, at least all of an investor’s 
assets would not be committed before he had had a warning signal to 
revise his investment technique or to get someone else to handle such 
matters for him. 

All  types  of  common  stock  investors  might  well  keep  one  basic 
thought in mind; otherwise the ﬁnancial community’s constant worry 
about and preoccupation with the danger of downswings in the busi- 
ness  cycle  will  paralyze  much  worthwhile  investment  action.  This 
thought is that here in the mid-twentieth century the current phase of 
the business cycle is but one of at least ﬁve powerful forces. All of these 
forces,  either  by  inﬂuencing  mass  psychology  or  by  direct  economic 
operation,  can  have  an  extremely  powerful  inﬂuence  on  the  general  
level of stock prices. 

The other four inﬂuences are the trend of interest rates, the over-all 
governmental  attitude  toward  investment  and  private  enterprise,  the 
long-range trend to more and more inﬂation, and—possibly most pow- 
erful of all—new inventions and techniques as they affect old industries. 
These forces are seldom all pulling stock prices in the same direction at 
the same time. Nor is any one of them necessarily going to be of vast- 
ly greater importance than any other for long periods of time. So com-
plex and diverse are these inﬂuences that the safest course to follow will 
be the one that at ﬁrst glance appears to be the most risky.This is to take 
investment  action  when  matters  you  know  about  a  speciﬁc  company 
appear to warrant such action. Be undeterred by fears or hopes based on 
conjectures, or conclusions based on surmises.

When to Sell

And When Not To 

There are many good reasons why an investor might decide to sell 

common stocks. He may want to build a new home or ﬁnance his  
son in a business. Any one of a number of similar reasons can, from  
the  standpoint  of  happy  living,  make  selling  common  stocks  sensible. 
This  type  of  selling,  however,  is  personal  rather  than  ﬁnancial  in  its 
motive. As such it is well beyond the scope of this book. These com-
ments are only designed to cover that type of selling that is motivated 
by  a  single  objective—obtaining  the  greatest  total  dollar  beneﬁt  from  
the investment dollars available. 

I believe there are three reasons, and three reasons only, for the sale 
of any common stock which has been originally selected according to 
the  investment  principles  already  discussed. The  ﬁrst  of  these  reasons 
should  be  obvious  to  anyone. This  is  when  a  mistake  has  been  made  
in the original purchase and it becomes increasingly clear that the fac-
tual background of the particular company is, by a signiﬁcant margin,  
less  favorable  than  originally  believed.  The  proper  handling  of  this 
type of situation is largely a matter of emotional self-control. To some 
degree  it  also  depends  upon  the  investor’s  ability  to  be  honest  with  
himself.

1 0 6  

Two of the important characteristics of common stock investment 
are the large proﬁts that can come with proper handling, and the high 
degree of skill, knowledge, and judgment required for such proper han-
dling. Since the process of obtaining these almost fantastic proﬁts is so 
complex, it is not surprising that a certain percentage of errors in pur- 
chasing are sure to occur. Fortunately the long-range proﬁts from really 
good common stocks should more than balance the losses from a nor-
mal percentage of such mistakes. They should leave a tremendous mar-
gin of gain as well. This is particularly true if the mistake is recognized 
quickly. When this happens, losses, if any, should be far smaller than if 
the stock bought in error had been held for a long period of time. Even 
more important, the funds tied up in the undesirable situation are freed 
to be used for something else which, if properly selected, should pro- 
duce substantial gains. 

However, there is a complicating factor that makes the handling of 
investment mistakes more difﬁcult. This is the ego in each of us. None 
of us likes to admit to himself that he has been wrong. If we have made 
a mistake in buying a stock but can sell the stock at a small proﬁt, we 
have somehow lost any sense of having been foolish. On the other hand, 
if we sell at a small loss we are quite unhappy about the whole matter. 
This reaction, while completely natural and normal, is probably one of 
the  most  dangerous  in  which  we  can  indulge  ourselves  in  the  entire 
investment  process.  More  money  has  probably  been  lost  by  investors 
holding a stock they really did not want until they could “at least come 
out even” than from any other single reason. If to these actual losses are  
added the proﬁts that might have been made through the proper rein- 
vestment of these funds if such reinvestment had been made when the 
mistake  was  ﬁrst  realized,  the  cost  of  self-indulgence  becomes  truly  
tremendous. 

Furthermore this dislike of taking a loss, even a small loss, is just as 
illogical as it is natural. If the real object of common stock investment is 
the making of a gain of a great many hundreds per cent over a period 
of years, the difference between, say, a 20 per cent loss or a 5 per cent 
proﬁt becomes a comparatively insigniﬁcant matter. What matters is not 
whether a loss occasionally occurs. What does matter is whether worth-
while proﬁts so often fail to materialize that the skill of the investor or 
his advisor in handling investments must be questioned. 

While  losses  should  never  cause  strong  self-disgust  or  emotional 
upset,  neither  should  they  be  passed  over  lightly. They  should  always  

When to Sell 

1 0 7 

be reviewed with care so that a lesson is learned from each of them. If  
the  particular  elements  which  caused  a  misjudgment  on  a  common 
stock  purchase  are  thoroughly  understood,  it  is  unlikely  that  another 
poor purchase will be made through misjudging the same investment 
factors. 

We come now to the second reason why sale should be made of a 
common stock purchased under the investment principles already out-
lined in Chapters Two and Three. Sales should always be made of the 
stock of a company which, because of changes resulting from the pas-
sage of time, no longer qualiﬁes in regard to the ﬁfteen points outlined 
in Chapter Three to about the same degree it qualiﬁed at the time of 
purchase. This is why investors should be constantly on their guard. It 
explains why it is of such importance to keep at all times in close contact 
with the affairs of companies whose shares are held. 

When companies deteriorate in this way they usually do so for one 
of two reasons. Either there has been a deterioration of management, or  
the company no longer has the prospect of increasing the markets for  
its product in the way it formerly did. Sometimes management deteri-
orates because success has affected one or more key executives. Smug-
ness,  complacency,  or  inertia  replace  the  former  drive  and  ingenuity. 
More often it occurs because a new set of top executives do not meas-
ure up to the standard of performance set by their predecessors. Either 
they no longer hold to the policies that have made the company out- 
standingly  successful,  or  they  do  not  have  the  ability  to  continue  to  
carry out such policies. When any of these things happen the affected 
stock should be sold at once, regardless of how good the general market 
may look or how big the capital gains tax may be. 

Similarly it sometimes happens that after growing spectacularly for 
many years, a company will reach a stage where the growth prospects of  
its markets are exhausted. From this time on it will only do about as well 
as industry as a whole. It will only progress at about the same rate as the 
national economy does. This change may not be due to any deteriora- 
tion of the management. Many managements show great skill in devel- 
oping  related  or  allied  products  to  take  advantage  of  growth  in  their 
immediate  ﬁeld. They  recognize,  however,  that  they  do  not  have  any 
particular advantage if they go into unrelated spheres of activity. Hence, 
if after years of being experts in a young and growing industry, times 
change and the company has pretty well exhausted the growth prospects 
of its market, its shares have deteriorated in an important way from the 

 
1 0 8  

standards outlined under our frequently mentioned ﬁfteen points. Such 
a stock should then be sold. 

In this instance, selling might take place at a more leisurely pace than  
if management deterioration had set in. Possibly part of the holding might  
be kept until a more suitable investment could be found. However, in any  
event, the company should be recognized as no longer suitable for worth- 
while investment. The amount of capital gains tax, no matter how large, 
should seldom prevent the switching of such funds into some other situ-
ation which, in the years ahead, may grow in a manner similar to the way 
in which this investment formerly grew. 

There is a good test as to whether companies no longer adequately 
qualify in regard to this matter of expected further growth. This is for 
the investor to ask himself whether at the next peak of a business cycle, 
regardless of what may happen in the meantime, the comparative per-
share earnings (after allowances for stock dividends and stock splits but 
not for new shares issued for additional capital) will probably show at 
least as great an increase from present levels as the present levels show 
from the last known peak of general business activity. If the answer is in 
the afﬁrmative, the stock probably should be held. If in the negative, it 
should probably be sold. 

For those who follow the right principles in making their original 
purchases, the third reason why a stock might be sold seldom arises, and  
should be acted upon only if an investor is very sure of his ground. It  
arises  from  the  fact  that  opportunities  for  attractive  investment  are 
extremely  hard  to  ﬁnd.  From  a  timing  standpoint,  they  are  seldom  
found just when investment funds happen to be available. If an investor  
has had funds for investment for quite a period of time and found few 
attractive situations into which to place these funds, he may well place 
some or all of them in a well-run company which he believes has def-
inite  growth  prospects.  However,  these  growth  prospects  may  be  at  a 
slower  average  annual  rate  than  may  appear  to  be  the  case  for  some  
other  seemingly  more  attractive  situation  that  is  found  later.  The  
already-owned company may in some other important aspects appear to 
be less attractive as well. 

If the evidence is clear-cut and the investor feels quite sure of his 
ground, it will, even after paying capital gains taxes, probably pay him  
handsomely  to  switch  into  the  situation  with  seemingly  better  
prospects. The company that can show an average annual increase of 12 
per cent for a long period of years should be a source of considerable 

When to Sell 

1 0 9 

ﬁnancial  satisfaction  to  its  owners.  However,  the  difference  between 
these  results  and  those  that  could  occur  from  a  company  showing  a  
20  per  cent  average  annual  gain  would  be  well  worth  the  additional 
trouble and capital gains taxes that might be involved. 

A word of caution may not be amiss, however, in regard to too read-
ily selling a common stock in the hope of switching these funds into a 
still better one. There is always the risk that some major element in the 
picture has been misjudged. If this happens, the investment probably will 
not turn out nearly as well as anticipated. In contrast, an alert investor 
who has held a good stock for some time usually gets to know its less 
desirable  as  well  as  its  more  desirable  characteristics. Therefore,  before 
selling a rather satisfactory holding in order to get a still better one, there 
is need of the greatest care in trying to appraise accurately all elements 
of the situation. 

At  this  point  the  critical  reader  has  probably  discerned  a  basic  
investment principle which by and large seems only to be understood  
by a small minority of successful investors. This is that once a stock has 
been properly selected and has borne the test of time, it is only occa- 
sionally  that  there  is  any  reason  for  selling  it  at  all.  However,  recom- 
mendations and comments continue to pour out of the ﬁnancial com- 
munity  giving  other  types  of  reasons  for  selling  outstanding  common 
stocks. What about the validity of such reasons? 

Most frequently given of such reasons is the conviction that a gen-
eral stock market decline of some proportion is somewhere in the off- 
ing. In the preceding chapter I tried to show that postponing an attrac-
tive purchase because of fear of what the general market might do will, 
over the years, prove very costly. This is because the investor is ignoring 
a powerful inﬂuence about which he has positive knowledge through 
fear of a less powerful force about which, in the present state of human 
knowledge, he and everyone else is largely guessing. If the argument is  
valid  that  the  purchase  of  attractive  common  stocks  should  not  be  
unduly  inﬂuenced  by  fear  of  ordinary  bear  markets,  the  argument  
against  selling  outstanding  stocks  because  of  these  fears  is  even  more 
impressive. All the arguments mentioned in the previous chapter equal- 
ly  apply  here.  Furthermore,  the  chance  of  the  investor  being  right  in 
making such sales is still further diminished by the factor of the capital  
gains  tax.  Because  of  the  very  large  proﬁts  such  outstanding  stocks  
should be showing if they have been held for a period of years, this cap-
ital gains tax can still further accentuate the cost of making such sales. 

 
1 1 0  

There  is  another  and  even  more  costly  reason  why  an  investor  
should never sell out of an outstanding situation because of the possi- 
bility that an ordinary bear market may be about to occur. If the com-
pany is really a right one, the next bull market should see the stock mak-
ing a new peak well above those so far attained. How is the investor to 
know when to buy back? Theoretically it should be after the coming 
decline. However, this presupposes that the investor will know when the  
decline will end. I have seen many investors dispose of a holding that 
was to show stupendous gain in the years ahead because of this fear of  
a coming bear market. Frequently the bear market never came and the  
stock went right on up. When a bear market has come, I have not seen 
one time in ten when the investor actually got back into the same shares  
before they had gone up above his selling price. Usually he either wait- 
ed for them to go far lower than they actually dropped, or, when they 
were way down, fear of something else happening still prevented their 
reinstatement. 

This brings us to another line of reasoning so often used to cause 
well-intentioned but unsophisticated investors to miss huge future prof-
its. This  is  the  argument  that  an  outstanding  stock  has  become  over-
priced and therefore should be sold. What is more logical than this? If a 
stock is overpriced, why not sell it rather than keep it? 

Before reaching hasty conclusions, let us look a little bit below the 
surface. Just what is overpriced? What are we trying to accomplish? Any 
really  good  stock  will  sell  and  should  sell  at  a  higher  ratio  to  current 
earnings  than  a  stock  with  a  stable  rather  than  an  expanding  earning 
power. After all, this probability of participating in continued growth is 
obviously worth something. When we say that the stock is overpriced, 
we may mean that it is selling at an even higher ratio in relation to this 
expected earning power than we believe it should be. Possibly we may 
mean that it is selling at an even higher ratio than are other compara- 
ble  stocks  with  similar  prospects  of  materially  increasing  their  future 
earnings. 

All of this is trying to measure something with a greater degree of 
preciseness than is possible. The investor cannot pinpoint just how much 
per share a particular company will earn two years from now. He can at  
best  judge  this  within  such  general  and  non-mathematical  limits  as 
“about  the  same,” “up  moderately,” “up  a  lot,”  or “up  tremendously.”  
As a matter of fact, the company’s top management cannot come a great 
deal  closer  than  this.  Either  they  or  the  investor  should  come  pretty 

When to Sell 

1 1 1 

close in judging whether a sizable increase in average earnings is likely 
to occur a few years from now. But just how much increase, or the exact 
year in which it will occur, usually involves guessing on enough vari-
ables to make precise predictions impossible. 

Under these circumstances, how can anyone say with even moder- 
ate precision just what is overpriced for an outstanding company with  
an unusually rapid growth rate? Suppose that instead of selling at twenty- 
ﬁve  times  earnings,  as  usually  happens,  the  stock  is  now  at  thirty-ﬁve 
times earnings. Perhaps there are new products in the immediate future, 
the  real  economic  importance  of  which  the  ﬁnancial  community  has 
not yet grasped. Perhaps there are not any such products. If the growth 
rate is so good that in another ten years the company might well have 
quadrupled, is it really of such great concern whether at the moment  
the stock might or might not be 35 per cent overpriced? That which 
really  matters  is  not  to  disturb  a  position  that  is  going  to  be  worth  a  
great deal more later. 

Again our old friend the capital gains tax adds its bit to these conclu- 
sions. Growth stocks which are recommended for sale because they are 
supposedly overpriced nearly always will cost their owners a sizable cap-
ital gains tax if they are sold. Therefore, in addition to the risk of losing a 
permanent position in a company which over the years should continue 
to show unusual further gains, we also incur a sizable tax liability. Isn’t it  
safer and cheaper simply to make up our minds that momentarily the 
stock may be somewhat ahead of itself? We already have a sizable proﬁt in 
it. If for a while the stock loses, say, 35 per cent of its current market quo- 
tation, is this really such a serious matter? Again, isn’t the maintaining of 
our position rather than the possibility of temporarily losing a small part 
of our capital gain the matter which is really important? 

There is still one other argument investors sometimes use to sepa-
rate themselves from the proﬁts they would otherwise make. This one is 
the most ridiculous of all. It is that the stock they own has had a huge 
advance. Therefore, just because it has gone up, it has probably used up 
most of its potential. Consequently they should sell it and buy some-
thing  that  hasn’t  gone  up  yet.  Outstanding  companies,  the  only  type 
which  I  believe  the  investor  should  buy,  just  don’t  function  this  way. 
How they do function might best be understood by considering the fol- 
lowing somewhat fanciful analogy: 

Suppose  it  is  the  day  you  graduated  from  college.  If  you  did  not 
go to college, consider it to be the day of your high school graduation; 

 
1 1 2  

from the standpoint of our example it will make no difference whatso- 
ever. Now suppose that on this day each of your male classmates had an  
urgent need of immediate cash. Each offered you the same deal. If you 
would give them a sum of money equivalent to ten times whatever they 
might earn during the ﬁrst twelve months after they had gone to work, 
that  classmate  would  for  the  balance  of  his  life  turn  over  to  you  one 
quarter  of  each  year’s  earnings!  Finally  let  us  suppose  that,  while  you 
thought this was an excellent proposition, you only had spare cash on 
hand sufﬁcient to make such a deal with three of your classmates. 

At  this  point,  your  reasoning  would  closely  resemble  that  of  the 
investor using sound investment principles in selecting common stocks. 
You  would  immediately  start  analyzing  your  classmates,  not  from  the 
standpoint  of  how  pleasant  they  might  be  or  even  how  talented  they 
might be in other ways, but solely to determine how much money they 
might make. If you were part of a large class, you would probably elim- 
inate quite a number solely on the ground of not knowing them sufﬁ-
ciently well to be able to pass worthwhile judgment on just how ﬁnan-
cially proﬁcient they actually would get to be. Here again, the analogy 
with intelligent common stock buying runs very close. 

Eventually you would pick the three classmates you felt would have  
the  greatest  future  earning  power. You  would  make  your  deal  with 
them. Ten years have passed. One of your three has done sensationally.  
Going to work for a large corporation, he has won promotion after pro- 
motion. Already insiders in the company are saying that the president  
has his eye on him and that in another ten years he will probably take 
the top job. He will be in line for the large compensation, stock options, 
and pension beneﬁts that go with that job. 

Under these circumstances, what would even the writers of stock mar- 
ket reports who urge taking proﬁts on superb stocks that “have gotten ahead 
of the market”think of your selling out your contract with this former class- 
mate, just because someone has offered you 600 per cent on your original 
investment? You would think that anyone would need to have his head 
examined if he were to advise you to sell this contract and replace it with 
one with another former classmate whose annual earnings still were about  
the same as when he left school ten years before. The argument that your  
successful classmate had had his advance while the advance of your (ﬁnan- 
cially) unsuccessful classmate still lay ahead of him would probably sound 
rather silly. If you know your common stocks equally well, many of the 
arguments commonly heard for selling the good one sound equally silly. 

When to Sell 

1 1 3 

You may be thinking all this sounds ﬁne, but actually classmates are  
not common stocks. To be sure, there is one major difference. That dif- 
ference increases rather than decreases the reason for never selling the 
outstanding common stock just because it has had a huge rise and may 
be temporarily overpriced. This difference is that the classmate is ﬁnite, 
may die soon and is sure to die eventually. There is no similar life span  
for  the  common  stock. The  company  behind  the  common  stock  can 
have  a  practice  of  selecting  management  talent  in  depth  and  training 
such  talent  in  company  policies,  methods,  and  techniques  in  a  way  
which will retain and pass on the corporate vigor for generations. Look 
at Du Pont in its second century of corporate existence. Look at Dow 
years  after  the  death  of  its  brilliant  founder.  In  this  era  of  unlimited 
human wants and incredible markets, there is no limitation to corporate 
growth such as the life span places upon the individual. 

Perhaps the thoughts behind this chapter might be put into a single 
sentence: If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is 
purchased, the time to sell it is—almost never.

The Hullabaloo about  
Dividends

There  is  a  considerable  degree  of  twisted  thinking  and  general  

acceptance  of  half  truths  about  a  number  of  aspects  of  common 
stock investments. However, whenever the signiﬁcance and impor-
tance of dividends are considered, the confusion of the typical investor 
becomes little short of monumental. 

This confusion and acceptance of half truths spreads over even to the  
choice of words customarily used in describing various types of dividend 
action. A corporation has been paying no dividend or a small one. Its 
president requests the board of directors to start paying a substantial div- 
idend. This is done. In speaking of this action he or the board will often 
describe  it  by  saying  that  the  time  had  come  to “do  something”  for 
stockholders. The inference is that by not paying or raising the dividend 
the company had been doing nothing for its stockholders. This could 
possibly be true. However, it certainly was not true just because no div-
idend action had been taken. It is possible that by spending earnings not 
as dividends but to build a new plant, to launch a new product line, or  
to install some major cost-saving equipment in an old plant, the man- 
agement might have been doing much more to beneﬁt the stockholder 
than it would have been doing just by passing these earnings out as div-
idends. No matter what might be done with any earnings not passed on 
as dividends, increases in the dividend rate are invariably referred to as 
“favorable” dividend action. Possibly with greater reason, reduction or 
elimination of dividends is nearly always called “unfavorable.” 

One of the main reasons for the confusion about dividends in the 
public mind is the great variation between the amount of beneﬁt, if any, 

1 1 4

The Hullabaloo about Dividends  

1 1 5 

that accrues to the stockholder each time earnings are not passed on to 
him but retained in the business. At times he is not beneﬁted at all by  
such  retained  earnings.  At  others  he  is  beneﬁted  only  in  a  negative  
sense. If the earnings were not retained, his holdings would decrease in 
value. However, the retained earnings in no sense increase the value of 
his holdings, therefore, they seem of no beneﬁt to him. Finally, in the 
many  cases  where  the  stockholder  beneﬁts  enormously  from  retained 
earnings the beneﬁts accrue in quite different proportions to different 
types  of  stockholders  within  the  same  company,  thereby  confusing 
investor thinking even more. In other words, each time earnings are not 
passed out as dividends, such action must be examined on its own merit 
to see exactly what is actually happening. It might pay to look a little 
below the surface here and discuss some of these differences in detail. 

When do stockholders get no beneﬁt from retained earnings? One 
way is when managements pile up cash and liquid assets far beyond any 
present  or  prospective  needs  of  the  business. The  management  might 
have no nefarious motive in doing this. Some executives get a sense of  
conﬁdence  and  security  from  steadily  piling  up  unneeded  liquid 
reserves. They don’t seem to realize they are buttressing their own feel- 
ings of security by not turning over to the stockholder wealth which he 
should be entitled to use in his own way and as he sees ﬁt. Today there 
are tax laws which tend to curb this evil so that while it still occurs, it  
is no longer the factor which it once was. 

There is another and more serious way in which earnings are fre-
quently retained in the business without any signiﬁcant beneﬁt to stock- 
holders. This occurs when substandard managements can get only a sub- 
normal return on the capital already in the business, yet use the retained 
earnings merely to enlarge the inefﬁcient operation rather than to make 
it better. What normally happens is that the management having in time 
built up a larger inefﬁcient domain over which to rule usually succeeds in  
justifying bigger salaries for itself on the grounds that it is doing a bigger 
job. The stockholders end up with little or no proﬁt. 

Neither of these situations is likely to affect the investor who fol-
lows  the  concept  discussed  in  this  book.  He  is  buying  stocks  because 
they are outstanding and not just because they are cheap. Managements 
with inefﬁcient and substandard operations would fail to qualify under 
our ﬁfteen points. Meanwhile, managements of the type that do quali- 
fy would almost certainly be ﬁnding uses for surplus cash and not just 
piling it up! 

 
1 1 6  

How  can  it  happen  that  earnings  retained  in  the  business  can  be 
vitally  needed  yet  have  no  possibility  of  increasing  the  value  of  the 
stockholder  shares? This  can  occur  in  one  of  two  ways.  One  way  is  
when  a  change  in  custom  or  public  demand  forces  each  competitive 
company to spend money on so-called assets which in no sense increase 
the volume of business, but which would cause a loss of business if the 
expenditure had not been made. A retail store installing an expensive air 
conditioning system is a classic example of this sort of thing. After each 
competitive store has installed such equipment, no net increase in busi-
ness will occur, yet any store which had not met the competitive move 
might ﬁnd very few customers on a hot summer day. Since for some 
strange reason our accepted accounting system and the tax laws which 
are based on it make no differentiation between “assets” of this type and 
those which have actually increased the value of the business, the stock-
holder frequently thinks that he has been badly treated when earnings 
have not been passed out to him and yet he can see no increase in value 
coming to him from what was retained in the business. 

The other and even more important way that retained earnings fail 
to produce increased proﬁts results from an even more serious failure of  
our  accepted  accounting  methods.  In  our  world  of  rapid  and  major 
changes in the purchasing value of our money units, standard account-
ing proceeds as though the dollar were a ﬁxed unit of value. Accoun-
tants say this is all accounting is supposed to do. This may very well be 
true; but if a balance sheet is supposed to have any relationship to the  
real  values  of  the  assets  described  thereon,  the  confusion  that  results 
seems about parallel to what would happen if engineers and scientists 
made their calculations in our three dimensional world by using only 
two dimensional plane geometry. 

The depreciation allowance in theory should be enough to replace 
an existing asset when that asset is no longer economically usable. If the 
depreciation rate were properly calculated and the replacement cost of 
the asset remained unchanged over its useful life, this would happen. But  
with  ever  rising  costs,  the  total  accumulated  depreciation  is  seldom 
enough to replace the outmoded asset. Therefore, additional sums must 
be retained from the earnings merely to make up the difference if the 
corporation is to continue to have what it had before. 

This type of thing, while affecting all investors, usually affects hold-
ers of growth companies less than any other class. This is because the  
rate of acquiring new capital assets (as against merely replacing  existing 

The Hullabaloo about Dividends  

1 1 7 

and about-to-be-retired assets) is usually so fast that more of the depre- 
ciation is on recently acquired assets installed at somewhere near today’s 
values. A  smaller  percentage  of  it  is  for  assets  installed  years  ago  at  a  
fraction of today’s costs. 

It would be repetitious to go into detail concerning the cases where 
retaining earnings for building new plants and launching new products 
has proven of spectacular advantage to investors. However, consideration 
of how much one type of investor beneﬁts in relation to another is wor-
thy of careful consideration for two reasons. It is a matter about which 
there is always misunderstanding throughout the ﬁnancial community.  
It is also a matter the proper understanding of which provides an easy 
key to evaluating the real signiﬁcance of dividends. 

Let us examine these misconceptions about who beneﬁts most from  
dividends  by  taking  a  ﬁctitious  example.  The  well-managed  XYZ  
Corporation has had a steady growth in its earnings over the last sever- 
al years. The dividend rate has remained the same. Consequently, where- 
as four years ago it took 50 per cent of earnings to pay the dividend, so  
much additional earning power has developed in these four years that 
paying the same dividend now requires only 25 per cent of this year’s 
earnings. Some directors want to raise the dividend. Others point out 
that never before has the corporation had so many attractive places to  
invest their retained earnings. They further point out that only by main- 
taining rather than raising the rate will it be possible to exploit all the 
attractive  opportunities  available.  Only  in  this  way  can  the  maximum 
growth be attained. At this point a lively discussion breaks out as to what 
course to follow. 

Someone  on  this  ﬁctitious  board  of  directors  is  then  sure  to  state 
one of the ﬁnancial community’s most common half-truths about div-
idends. This is that if the XYZ Corporation does not raise its dividend, 
it will be favoring its large stockholders at the expense of its small ones. 
The theory behind this is that the big stockholder is presumably in the 
higher bracket. After paying taxes, the big stockholder can retain a much 
smaller percentage of his dividends than the small stockholder. There-
fore he does not want the increased dividend, whereas the small stock-
holder does want it. 

Actually, whether it is more to the interest of any individual XYZ 
Corporation stockholder to have the dividend raised or to have more 
funds  ploughed  back  into  the  growth  depends  upon  something  quite 
different from the size of his income. It depends upon whether or not 

 
1 1 8  

each  stockholder  is  at  the  point  where  he  is  putting  any  part  of  his 
income aside for additional investment. Millions of stockholders in the 
lower income brackets are handling their affairs so that each year they 
put something, no matter how little, aside for additional investment. If 
they  are  doing  this  and  if,  as  is  likely  to  be  the  case,  they  are  paying 
income  tax,  it  is  a  matter  of  elementary  arithmetic  that  the  board  of 
directors would be acting against their interests by raising the dividend 
at  a  time  when  all  these  worthwhile  opportunities  are  available  for  
using retained company earnings. In contrast, the raised dividend might 
be to the interest of a big stockholder who had urgent need of addi-
tional funds, a contingency not entirely unknown to those in high tax 
brackets. 

Let us see just why all this is so. Almost anyone having enough sur- 
plus  funds  to  own  common  stocks  will  probably  also  have  enough 
income to be in at least the lowest tax bracket. Therefore, once he has 
used  up  his  individual  dividend  exemption  of  $50,  even  the  smallest 
stockholder will presumably have to pay as tax at least 20 per cent of any  
additional income he receives as dividends. In addition, he must pay a  
brokerage  commission  on  any  stock  he  buys.  Because  of  odd  lot  
charges, minimum commissions, etc., these costs run to a much larger 
percentage of the sums involved in small purchases than in large ones. 
This will bring the actual capital available for reinvestment well below 
80 per cent of the amount received. If the shareholder is in a higher tax 
bracket, the percentage of a dividend increase which he can actually use 
for reinvestment becomes proportionately less. 

There are, of course, certain special types of stockholders such as uni- 
versities and pension funds that pay no income tax. There are also some 
individuals with dividend income less than the $50 individual exemp-
tion, although the total number of shares owned by this group appears to  
be  small.  For  these  special  groups  the  equation  is  somewhat  different. 
However,  for  the  great  majority  of  all  stockholders,  regardless  of  size, 
there is no avoiding this one basic fact about dividends. If they are sav-
ing any part of their income rather than spending it and if they have their  
funds invested in the right sort of common stocks, they are better off 
when the managements of such companies reinvest increased earnings 
than they would be if these increased earnings were passed on to them  
as larger dividends which they would have to reinvest themselves. 

Nor  is  this  advantage—having  100  per  cent  of  such  funds  put  to 
work for them in place of the smaller amount that would be  available 

The Hullabaloo about Dividends  

1 1 9 

after income taxes and brokerage charges—the only one the stockhold- 
ers get. Selecting the right common stock is not an easy or simple mat-
ter. If the company considering the dividends is a good one, the investor 
has already wisely done his task of selection. Therefore, he is usually run- 
ning  less  risk  in  having  this  good  management  make  the  additional 
investment of these retained extra earnings than he would be running if  
he  had  to  again  risk  serious  error  in  ﬁnding  some  new  and  equally 
attractive  investment  for  himself. The  more  outstanding  the  company 
considering whether to retain or pass on increased earnings, the more 
important this factor can become. This is why even the stockholder who  
does  not  pay  income  tax  and  who  is  not  spending  every  bit  of  his  
income ﬁnds it almost as much to his interest as to the interest of his  
tax-paying  counterpart  to  have  such  companies  retain  funds  to  take 
advantage of worthwhile new opportunities. 

Measured against this background dividends begin to fall into true 
perspective. For those desiring the greatest beneﬁt from the use of their 
funds, dividends begin rapidly to lose the importance that many in the  
ﬁnancial  community  give  them. This  is  as  true  for  the  conservative  
investor going into the institutional type growth stock as for those willing  
and able to take greater risks for greater gain. The opinion is sometimes  
expressed  that  a  high  dividend  return  is  a  factor  of  safety. The  theory 
behind this is that since the high-yield stock is already offering an above- 
average return, it cannot be overpriced and is not likely to go down very  
much. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Every study I have seen  
on this subject indicates that far more of those stocks giving a bad per- 
formance price-wise have come from the high dividend-paying rather 
than the low dividend-paying group. An otherwise good management 
which increases dividends, and thereby sacriﬁces worthwhile opportuni- 
ties for reinvesting increased earnings in the business, is like the manager 
of a farm who rushes his magniﬁcent livestock to market the minute he 
can sell them rather than raising them to the point where he can get the 
maximum price above his costs. He has produced a little more cash right 
now but at a frightful cost. 

I have commented about a corporation raising its dividend rather 
than about it paying any dividend at all. I am aware that while the occa-
sional investor might not need any income, nearly all do. It is only in rare  
cases,  even  among  outstanding  corporations,  that  the  opportunity  for 
growth is so great that the management cannot afford to pay some part  
of  earnings  and  still—through  retaining  the  rest  and  through  senior 

 
1 2 0  

ﬁnancing—obtain  adequate  cash  to  take  advantage  of  worthwhile  
growth opportunities. Each investor must decide in relation to his own 
needs  how  much,  if  any,  money  to  put  into  corporations  with  such 
abnormal  growth  factors  that  no  dividends  whatsoever  are  justiﬁed. 
What is most important, however, is that stocks are not bought in com-
panies where the dividend pay-out is so emphasized that it restricts real- 
izable growth. 

This brings us to what is probably the most important but least dis-
cussed aspect of dividends. This is regularity or dependability. The wise 
investor will plan his affairs. He will look ahead to what he can or can-
not do with his income. He may not care about immediately increas- 
ing  income  but  he  will  want  assurance  against  the  decreased  income  
and  unexpected  disruption  of  his  plans  that  this  can  cause.  Further- 
more,  he  will  want  to  make  his  own  decisions  between  companies  
which should plough back a great part or all of their earnings and those 
that  may  grow  at  a  good  but  slower  rate  and  need  to  plough  back  a 
smaller proportion. 

For  these  reasons,  those  who  set  wise  policies  on  stockholder 
 relations  and  those  who  enjoy  the  high  price-earnings  ratios  for  their 
shares, which such policies help bring about, usually avoid the muddled 
thinking  that  typiﬁes  so  many  corporate  treasurers  and  ﬁnancial  vice 
presidents. They set a dividend policy and will not change it. They will 
let stockholders know what this policy is. They may substantially change 
the dividend but seldom the policy. 

This policy will be based on the percentage of earnings that should 
be retained in the business for maximum growth. For younger and rap-
idly growing companies, it may be that no dividends at all will be paid 
for  so  many  years. Then  when  assets  have  been  brought  to  the  point 
where the depreciation ﬂow-back is greater, from 25 to 40 per cent of 
proﬁts will be paid out to stockholders. For older companies this pay-
out ratio will vary from company to company. However, in no case will 
the  rough  percentages  govern  the  exact  amount  paid  out;  this  would 
make each year’s dividend different from that of the year before. This is  
just what stockholders do not want, since it makes impossible independ- 
ent long-range planning on their part. What they desire is a set amount 
approximating  these  percentages  and  paid  out  regularly—quarterly, 
semiannually,  or  annually,  as  the  case  may  be.  As  earnings  grow,  the 
amount will occasionally be increased to bring the pay-out up to the 
former percentage. This, however, will only be done when a) funds are 

The Hullabaloo about Dividends  

1 2 1 

otherwise  available  for  taking  advantage  of  all  the  good  opportunities  
for growth that the management is uncovering and b) there is every rea- 
son  to  believe  that  this  new  regular  rate  can  be  maintained  from  this 
time on, after allowing for all reasonable probabilities of a subsequent 
downturn in the business or the appearance of additional opportunities 
for growth. 

The managements whose dividend policies win the widest approval 
among discerning investors are those who hold that a dividend should  
be raised with the greatest caution and only when there is great proba- 
bility that it can be maintained. Similarly, only in the gravest of emer- 
gencies  should  such  dividends  be  lowered.  It  is  surprising  how  many 
corporate  ﬁnancial  ofﬁcers  will  approve  the  paying  of  one-shot  extra 
dividends. They do this even though such unanticipated extra dividends 
almost always fail to leave a permanent impact on the market price of 
their shares—which should indicate how contrary such policies are to 
the desires of most long-range investors. 

No matter how wise or foolish a dividend policy may be, a corpo- 
ration can usually in time get an investor following which likes the par- 
ticular policy, provided that the corporation follows the policy consis- 
tently. Many stockholders, whether it is to their best interests or not, still 
like a high rate of return. Others like a low rate. Others like none at all. 
Some like a very low rate combined with a small regular annual stock 
dividend.  Others  do  not  want  this  stock  dividend,  preferring  the  low 
rate by itself. If a management selects one of these policies in line with 
its  natural  needs,  it  usually  builds  up  a  stockholder  group  which  likes  
and comes to expect the continuation of such a policy. A wise manage- 
ment wishing to obtain investment prestige for its stock will respect that 
desire for continuity. 

There is perhaps a close parallel between setting policy in regard to 
dividends and setting policy on opening a restaurant. A good restaurant 
man might build up a splendid business with a high-priced venture. He 
might also build up a splendid business with an attractive place selling 
the best possible meals at the lowest possible prices. Or he could make 
a success of Hungarian, Chinese, or Italian cuisine. Each would attract a 
following. People would come there expecting a certain kind of meal. 
However, with all his skill, he could not possibly build up a clientele if  
one day he served the costliest meals, the next day low-priced ones, and  
then without warning served nothing but exotic dishes. The corpora- 
tion that keeps shifting its dividend policies becomes as unsuccessful in 

 
1 2 2  

attracting a permanent shareholder following. Its shares do not make the 
best long-range investments. 

As long as dividend policy is consistent, so that investors can plan 
ahead with some assurance, this whole matter of dividends is a far less 
important part of the investment picture than might be judged from the 
endless arguments frequently heard about the relative desirability of this 
dividend  policy  or  that. The  large  groups  in  the  ﬁnancial  community 
that would dispute this view fail to explain the number of stocks that 
have offered no prospect of anything but below-average yield for years 
ahead, yet which have done so well for their owners. Several examples  
of such stocks have already been mentioned. Another typical investment 
of this type is Rohm & Haas. This stock ﬁrst became publicly available  
in 1949, when a group of investment bankers purchased a large block 
held  by  the Alien  Property  Custodian  and  reoffered  it  publicly. The  
public offering price was $41.25. At that time the stock was paying only 
$1.00  in  dividends,  supplemented  by  stock  dividends.  Many  investors 
felt that in view of the low yield the stock was unattractive for conser- 
vative investment. Since this date, however, the company has continued 
to pay stock dividends, has raised the cash dividend at frequent intervals 
although the yield has remained very low, and the stock has sold at well 
over 400. The original owner of Rohm & Haas has received stock div-
idends of 4 per cent each year from 1949 through 1955, and 3 per cent 
in 1956, so his capital gain has been well over ten-fold. 

Actually dividend considerations should be given the least, not the 
most, weight by those desiring to select outstanding stocks. Perhaps the 
most peculiar aspect of this much-discussed subject of dividends is that 
those giving them the least consideration usually end up getting the best  
dividend return. Worthy of repetition here is that over a span of ﬁve to 
ten years, the best dividend results will come not from the high-yield 
stocks but from those with the relatively low yield. So proﬁtable are the  
results  of  the  ventures  opened  up  by  exceptional  managements  that 
while they still continue the policy of paying out a low proportion of 
current  earnings,  the  actual  number  of  dollars  paid  out  progressively 
exceed  what  could  have  been  obtained  from  high-yield  shares. Why 
shouldn’t this logical and natural trend continue in the future?

Five Don’ts for Investors

1.  Don’t buy into promotional companies. 

Close  to  the  very  heart  of  successful  investing  is  ﬁnding  companies 
which  are  developing  new  products  and  processes  or  exploiting  new 
markets. Companies that have just started or are about to be started are  
frequently  attempting  to  do  just  this.  Many  of  them  are  formed  to 
develop  a  colorful  new  invention.  Many  are  started  to  participate  in  
industries, such as electronics, in which there is great growth potential.  
Another  large  group  is  formed  to  discover  mineral  or  other  natural 
wealth—a ﬁeld where the rewards for success can be outstanding. For 
these reasons, young companies not yet earning a proﬁt on their oper-
ations may at ﬁrst glance appear to be of investment value. 

There is another argument which frequently increases interest. This 
is  that  by  buying  now  when  the  ﬁrst  shares  are  offered  to  the  public, 
there is a chance to “get in on the ground ﬂoor.” The successful com-
pany is now selling at several times the price at which it was originally  
offered.  Therefore  why  wait  and  have  somebody  else  make  all  this 
money?  Instead  why  not  use  the  same  methods  of  inquiry  and  judg-
ment in ﬁnding the outstanding new enterprise now being promoted as 
can be used in ﬁnding the outstanding established corporation? 

From  the  investment  standpoint,  I  believe  there  is  a  basic  matter 
which puts any company without at least two or three years of com- 
mercial operation and one year of operating proﬁt in a completely dif- 
ferent category from an established company—even one so small that  
it  may  not  have  more  than  a  million  dollars  of  annual  sales.  In  the  

1 2 3

1 2 4  

established  company,  all  the  major  functions  of  the  business  are  cur-
rently  operating. The  investor  can  observe  the  company’s  production,  
sales,  cost  accounting,  management  teamwork,  and  all  the  other  
aspects of its operations. Perhaps even more important, he can obtain  
the  opinion  of  other  qualiﬁed  observers  who  are  in  a  position  to  
observe  regularly  some  or  all  of  these  points  of  relative  strength  or  
weakness  in  the  company  under  consideration.  In  contrast,  when  a 
company is still in the promotional stage, all an investor or anyone else 
can  do  is  look  at  a  blueprint  and  guess  what  the  problems  and  the  
strong  points  may  be. This  is  a  much  more  difﬁcult  thing  to  do.  It  
allows a much greater probability of error in the conclusions reached. 
Actually,  it  is  so  difﬁcult  to  do  that  no  matter  how  skillful  the  
investor, it makes it impossible to obtain even a fraction of the “batting  
average”  for  selecting  outstanding  companies  that  can  be  attained  if 
judgment  is  conﬁned  to  established  operations. All  too  often,  young 
promotional companies are dominated by one or two individuals who 
have great talent for certain phases of business procedure but are lack-
ing in other equally essential talents. They may be superb salesmen but 
lack other types of business ability. More often they are inventors or pro- 
duction men, totally unaware that even the best products need skillful 
marketing as well as manufacture. The investor is seldom in a position 
to convince such individuals of the skills missing in themselves or their 
young organizations. Usually he is even less in a position to point out  
to such individuals where such talents may be found. 

For these reasons, no matter how appealing promotional companies 
may seem at ﬁrst glance, I believe their ﬁnancing should always be left 
to specialized groups. Such groups have management talent available to  
bolster up weak spots as unfolding operations uncover them. Those who  
are not in a position to supply such talent and to convince new man- 
agements of the need of taking advantage of such help will ﬁnd invest-
ing in promotional companies largely a disillusioning experience. There 
are enough spectacular opportunities among established companies that 
ordinary individual investors should make it a rule never to buy into a 
promotional enterprise, no matter how attractive it may appear to be. 

2.  Don’t ignore a good stock just because it is traded  
“over the counter.” 

The  attractiveness  of  unlisted  stocks  versus  those  listed  on  a  stock 
exchange is closely related to the marketability of one group as against 

Five Don’ts for Investors 

1 2 5 

the other. Everyone should recognize the importance of marketability. 
Normally, most if not all buying should be conﬁned to stocks which can  
be  sold  should  a  reason—either  ﬁnancial  or  personal—arise  for  such  
selling.  However,  some  confusion  seems  to  exist  in  the  minds  of  
investors as to what gives adequate protection in this regard and what 
does not. This in turn gives rise to even more confusion concerning the 
desirability of those stocks not listed on any exchange. Such stocks are 
commonly called “over-the-counter” stocks. 

The reason for this confusion lies in basic changes that have come 
over  common  stock  buying  in  the  last  quarter  century—changes  that 
make the markets of the 1950’s very different even from those as recent 
as the never-to-be-forgotten 1920’s. During most of the 1920’s and in  
all of the period before that, the stock broker had as customers a rela-
tively small number of rather rich men. Most buying was done in large 
blocks, frequently in multiples of thousands of shares. The motive was 
usually to sell out to someone else at a higher price. Gambling rather 
than investment was the order of the day. Buying on margin—that is, 
with  borrowed  funds—was  then  the  accepted  method  of  operation. 
Today a very large percentage of all buying is on a cash basis. 

Many things have happened to change these colorful markets of the 
past. High income and inheritance tax rates are one. A more important 
inﬂuence is the tendency toward a levelling of incomes that continues 
year after year in every section of the United States. The very rich and 
the very poor each year grow smaller in number. Each year the middle 
groups grow larger. This has produced a steady shrinkage of big stock 
buyers, and an even greater growth of small stock buyers. Along with 
them has come a tremendous growth in another class of stock buyer, the 
institutional buyer. The investment trust, the pension and proﬁt-sharing 
trusts, even to some degree the trust departments of the great banks do  
not represent a few big buyers. Rather they are a few professional man-
agers  entrusted  with  handling  the  collective  savings  of  innumerable 
small buyers. 

Partly as a result of all this, and partly as a cause helping to bring 
it about, basic changes have come in our laws and institutions as they 
affect  the  stock  market.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  
has  been  created  to  prevent  the  type  of  manipulation  and  pool  oper- 
ation that spurred on the rampant stock market gambling of the past. 
Rules  are  in  force  limiting  margin  buying  to  a  fraction  of  what  was 
formerly considered customary. But most important of all, as already dis- 
cussed in an earlier chapter, the corporation of today is a very  different 

 
1 2 6  

thing  from  what  it  used  to  be.  For  the  reasons  already  explained,  
today’s  corporation  is  designed  to  be  far  more  suitable  as  an  invest- 
ment medium for those desiring long-range growth than as a vehicle  
for in-and-out trading. 

All  this  has  profoundly  changed  the  market  place.  It  undoubtedly  
represents  tremendous  improvement—improvement,  however,  at  the  
expense  of  marketability.  The  liquidity  of  the  average  stock  has  
decreased  rather  than  increased.  In  spite  of  breathtaking  economic 
growth and a seemingly endless procession of stock splits, the volume of 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange has declined. For the smaller 
exchanges  it  has  almost  vanished. The  gambler,  the  in-and-out  buyer, 
and even the “sucker” trying to outguess the pool manipulator were not  
conducive  to  a  healthy  economy. They  did,  however,  help  provide  a 
ready market. 

I do not want to get involved in semantics. Nevertheless, it must be  
realized  that  this  has  resulted  in  the  gradual  decline  of  the  “stock  
broker” and the rise of what might be called the “stock salesman.” So far  
as stocks are concerned, the broker works in an auction market. He takes  
an  order  from  someone  who  has  already  decided  on  his  investment 
course. He matches this order with an order he or some other broker  
has  received  to  sell. This  process  is  not  overly  time-consuming.  If  the 
orders received are for a large rather than small number of shares, the 
broker can operate on a very small commission for each share handled 
and still end the year with a handsome proﬁt. 

Contrast him with the salesman, who must go through the far more 
time-consuming routine of persuading the customer on the course of 
action to be taken. There are only a given number of hours in the day. 
Therefore,  to  make  a  proﬁt  commensurate  with  that  of  a  broker,  he  
must  charge  a  higher  commission  for  his  services. This  is  particularly 
true if the salesman is serving a large number of small customers rather 
than a few big ones. Under todays economic conditions, small customers 
are the ones most salesmen must serve. 

The  stock  exchanges  are  still  primarily  operating  as  a  vehicle  for 
stock brokers rather than stock salesmen. Their commission rates have 
gone up. They have only gone up, however, about in proportion to that 
of most other types of services. In contrast, the over-the-counter mar-
kets work on a quite different principle. Each day, designated members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers furnish the newspapers  
of that region with quotations on a long list of the more active unlisted 

Five Don’ts for Investors 

1 2 7 

securities of interest to stockholders in that locality. These are  compiled 
by close contact with the over-the-counter houses most active in trad- 
ing  each  of  these  securities.  Unlike  those  furnished  by  the  stock 
exchanges, these quotations are not the price ranges within which trans- 
actions took place. They cannot be, for there is no central clearing house 
to which transactions are reported. Instead these are bid-and-ask quota- 
tions. Such quotations supposedly give the highest price at which any  
of the interested ﬁnancial houses will bid for each of these shares and  
the lowest offering price at which they will sell them. 

Close checking will nearly always show that the reported quotations 
on the bid or buy side are closely in line with what could be obtained  
for shares at the moment the quotation was furnished. The sales or ask 
side is usually higher than the bid by an amount several times greater  
than the equivalent stock exchange commission for shares selling at the 
same price. This difference is calculated to enable the over-the-counter 
house to buy at the bid price, pay its salesmen an appropriate commis- 
sion for the time spent in selling the security, and still leave a reasonable 
proﬁt after allowing for general overhead. On the other hand, if a cus- 
tomer, particularly a large customer, approaches the same ﬁnancial house  
with  a  bid  to  buy  this  stock  so  that  no  salesman’s  commission  is 
involved, he can usually buy it at the bid price plus just about the equiv- 
alent of the stock exchange commission. As one over-the-counter deal- 
er expressed it, “We have one market on the buy side. On the selling side  
we have two. We have a retail and a wholesale market, depending part- 
ly on the size of the purchase and partly on the amount of selling and 
servicing that is involved.” 

This  system  in  the  hands  of  an  unscrupulous  dealer  is  subject  to 
obvious abuse. So is any other system. But if the investor picks the over-
the-counter dealer with the same care he should employ in choosing 
any other specialist to serve him, it works surprisingly well. The average 
investor has neither the time nor the ability to select his own securities. 
Through  the  close  supervision  dealers  give  the  securities  they  permit 
their salesmen to offer, he is receiving in effect something closely resem-
bling investment counsel. As such it should be worth the cost involved. 
From  the  standpoint  of  the  more  sophisticated  investor,  however,  
the real beneﬁts of this system are not in regard to buying. They are in 
regard to the increased liquidity or marketability which it produces for 
those unlisted stocks he may desire to own. Because the proﬁt margin 
available for dealers in such stocks is large enough to make it  worthwhile, 

 
1 2 8  

a great many over-the-counter dealers keep a regular inventory of the 
stocks they normally handle. They usually are not at all reluctant to take  
on  additional  500-  or  1000-share  lots  when  they  become  available. 
When larger blocks appear in their favorite issues, they will frequently 
hold a sales meeting and put on a special drive to move the shares that 
may be available. Normally they will ask a special selling commission of 
a point or so for doing this. However, all this means that if an over-the-
counter stock is regularly dealt in by two or more high-grade over-the-
counter dealers, it usually has a sufﬁcient degree of marketability to take 
care of the needs of most investors. Depending on the amount offered,  
a special selling commission may or may not be required to move a large 
block. However, for what is at most a relatively small percentage of the 
sales price, the stock which the investor desires to sell can actually be 
converted into cash without breaking the market. 

How does this compare with the marketability of a stock listed on a 
stock exchange? The answer depends largely on what stock and on what 
stock exchange. For the larger and more active issues listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange, even under today’s conditions a big enough auc-
tion market still exists so that in normal times all but the largest blocks 
can be moved at the low prevailing commission rates without depressing 
prices. For the less active stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, 
this marketability factor is still fair, but at times can sag rather badly if reg- 
ular commissions are depended on when large selling orders appear. For 
common stocks listed on the small exchanges, it is my opinion that this 
marketability factor frequently becomes considerably worse. 

The stock exchanges have recognized this situation and have taken 
steps to meet it. Nowadays, whenever a block of a listed stock appears 
which the exchange thinks is too big to market in the normal fashion, 
permission may be given for the use of devices such as “special offer-
ings.” This simply means that the offering is made known to all mem-
bers, who are given a predetermined larger commission for selling these 
shares. In other words, when the block is too large for the brokers to 
handle it as brokers, they are given commissions large enough to reward 
them for selling as salesmen. 

All this narrows the apparent gap between listed and unlisted mar-
kets  in  a  period  such  as  the  present,  when  more  and  more  purchases 
are  being  handled  by  salesmen  rather  than  by  brokers  who  just  take 
orders.  It  does  not  mean  that  from  the  standpoint  of  marketability  a 
well-known,  actively-traded  stock  on  the  New York  Stock  Exchange  

Five Don’ts for Investors 

1 2 9 

has  no  advantage  over  the  better  over-the-counter  stocks.  It  does  
mean  that  the  better  of  these  over-the-counter  stocks  are  frequently 
more  liquid  than  the  shares  of  many  of  the  companies  listed  on  the 
American  Stock  Exchange  and  the  various  regional  stock  exchanges.  
I  imagine  those  connected  with  the  smaller  stock  exchanges  would 
 sincerely  disagree  with  this  statement.  Nevertheless,  I  believe  an  
unprejudiced study of the facts would show it  to be true. It is why a 
number  of  the  more  progressive  of  smaller  and  medium-size  compa- 
nies  have  in  recent  years  refused  to  list  their  stocks  on  the  smaller 
exchanges.  Instead  they  have  chosen  the  over-the-counter  markets  
until  their  companies  reach  a  size  that  would  warrant “big  board”—  
that is, New York Stock Exchange—listing. 

In  short,  so  far  as  over-the-counter  securities  are  concerned,  the 
rules for the investor are not too different from those for listed securi- 
ties. First, be very sure that you have picked the right security. Then be 
sure you have selected an able and conscientious broker. If an investor is  
on sound ground in both these respects, he need have no fear of pur- 
chasing stock just because it is traded “over-the-counter” rather than on 
an exchange. 

3.  Don’t buy a stock just because you like the “tone”  
of its annual report. 

Investors are not always careful to analyze just what has caused them to 
buy one stock rather than another. If they did, they might be surprised 
how often they were inﬂuenced by the wording and format of the gen-
eral comments in a company’s annual report to stockholders. This tone 
of the annual report may reﬂect the management’s philosophies, policies, 
or goals with as much accuracy as the audited ﬁnancial statement should 
reﬂect the dollars and cents results for the period involved. The annual 
report may also, however, reﬂect little more than the skill of the compa- 
ny’s  public  relations  department  in  creating  an  impression  about  the 
company in the public mind. There is no way of telling whether the pres-
ident has actually written the remarks in an annual report, or whether a  
public relations ofﬁcer has written them for his signature. Attractive pho- 
tographs and nicely colored charts do not necessarily reﬂect a close-knit 
and able management team working in harmony and with enthusiasm. 
Allowing the general wording and tone of an annual report to inﬂu-
ence  a  decision  to  purchase  a  common  stock  is  much  like  buying  a 

 
1 3 0  

product because of an appealing advertisement on a billboard. The prod-
uct may be just as attractive as the advertisement. It also may not be. For  
a low-priced product it may be quite sensible to buy in this way, to ﬁnd  
out how attractive the purchase really is. With a common stock, howev- 
er,  few  of  us  are  rich  enough  to  afford  impulse  buying.  It  is  well  to 
remember that annual reports nowadays are generally designed to build 
up  stockholder  good  will.  It  is  important  to  go  beyond  them  to  the 
underlying facts. Like any other sales tool they are prone to put a cor- 
poration’s “best foot forward.” They seldom present balanced and com-
plete  discussions  of  the  real  problems  and  difﬁculties  of  the  business. 
Often they are too optimistic. 

If, then, an investor should not let a favorable reaction to the tone  
of an annual report overly inﬂuence his subsequent action, how about 
the  opposite?  Should  he  let  an  unfavorable  reaction  inﬂuence  him?  
Usually not, for again it is like trying to appraise the contents of a box 
by the wrapping paper on the outside. There is one important excep- 
tion  to  this,  however. This  is  when  such  reports  fail  to  give  proper  
information on matters of real signiﬁcance to the investor. Companies 
which follow such policies are usually not the ones most likely to pro-
vide the background for successful investment. 

4.  Don’t assume that the high price at which a stock  
may be selling in relation to earnings is necessarily an  
indication that further growth in those earnings has  
largely been already discounted in the price. 

There is a costly error in investment reasoning that is common enough 
to make it worthy of special mention. To explain it, let us take a ﬁcti-
tious company. We might call it the XYZ Corporation. XYZ has qual-
iﬁed  magniﬁcently  for  years  in  regard  to  our  ﬁfteen  points.  For  three 
decades  there  has  been  constant  growth  in  both  sales  and  proﬁts,  and 
also there have been enough new products under development to fur- 
nish strong indication of comparable growth in the period ahead. The 
excellence  of  the  company  is  generally  appreciated  throughout  the 
ﬁnancial  community.  Consequently  for  years  XYZ  stock  has  sold  for 
from  twenty  to  thirty  times  current  earnings. This  is  nearly  twice  as 
much for each dollar earned as the sales price of the average stock that 
has made up, say, the Dow Jones Industrial Averages. 

Five Don’ts for Investors 

1 3 1 

Today this stock is selling at just twice the price-earnings ratio of 
the Dow Jones averages. This means that its market price is twice as high  
in relation to each dollar it is earning as is the average of the stocks com- 
prising  these  Dow  Jones  averages  in  relation  to  each  dollar  they  are 
earning. The XYZ management has just issued a forecast indicating it 
expects to double earnings in the next ﬁve years. On the basis of the 
evidence at hand, the forecast looks valid. 

Whereupon a surprising number of investors jump to false conclu- 
sions. They say that since XYZ is selling twice as high as stocks in gen-
eral, and since it will take ﬁve years for XYZ’s earnings to double, the 
present price of XYZ stock is discounting future earnings ahead. They 
are sure the stock is overpriced. 

No  one  can  argue  that  a  stock  discounting  its  earnings  ﬁve  years 
ahead is likely to be overpriced. The fallacy in their reasoning lies in the 
assumption that ﬁve years from now XYZ will be selling on the same 
price-earnings  ratio  as  will  the  average  Dow  Jones  stock  with  which 
they compare it. For thirty years this stock, because of all those factors 
which  make  it  an  outstanding  company,  has  been  selling  at  twice  the 
price-earnings ratio of these other stocks. Its record has been rewarding 
to those who have placed their faith in it. If the same policies are con- 
tinued, ﬁve years from now its management will bring out still another 
group of new products that in the ensuing decade will swell earnings in 
the same way that new products are increasing earnings now and oth- 
ers  did  ﬁve,  ten,  ﬁfteen,  and  twenty  years  ago.  If  this  happens,  why 
shouldn’t this stock sell ﬁve years from now for twice the price-earnings 
ratio of these more ordinary stocks just as it is doing now and has done 
for many years past? If it does, and if the price-earnings ratio of all stocks 
remain about the same, XYZ’s doubling of earnings ﬁve years from now 
will also cause its price to have doubled in the market over this ﬁve-year 
period. On this basis, this stock, selling at its normal price-earnings ratio, 
cannot be said to be discounting future earnings at all! 

Obvious, isn’t it? Well, look around you and see how many suppos- 
edly sophisticated investors get themselves crossed up on this matter of 
what price-earnings ratio to use in considering how far ahead a stock is 
actually discounting future growth. This is particularly true if a change 
has been taking place in the background of the company being studied.  
Let us now consider the ABC Company instead of the XYZ Corpora- 
tion. The two companies are almost exactly alike except that the ABC 

 
1 3 2  

Company  is  much  younger.  Only  in  the  last  two  years  has  its  funda- 
mental excellence been appreciated by the ﬁnancial community to the 
point that its shares, too, are now selling at twice the price-earnings ratio 
of  the  average  Dow  Jones  stock.  It  seems  almost  impossible  for  many 
investors to realize, in the case of a stock that in the past has not sold at 
a comparably high price-earnings ratio, that the price-earnings ratio at 
which it is now selling may be a reﬂection of its intrinsic quality and  
not an unreasonable discounting of further growth. 

What is important here is thoroughly understanding the nature of 
the company, with particular reference to what it may be expected to  
do some years from now. If the earning spurt that lies ahead is a one-
time matter, and the nature of the company is not such that compara- 
ble new sources of earning growth will be developed when the present 
one is fully exploited, that is quite a different situation. Then the high 
price-earnings ratio does discount future earnings. This is because, when 
the present spurt is over, the stock will settle back to the same selling 
price in relation to its earnings as run-of-the-mill shares. However, if the  
company  is  deliberately  and  consistently  developing  new  sources  of 
earning  power,  and  if  the  industry  is  one  promising  to  afford  equal 
growth spurts in the future, the price-earnings ratio ﬁve or ten years in 
the future is rather sure to be as much above that of the average stock  
as  it  is  today.  Stocks  of  this  type  will  frequently  be  found  to  be  dis- 
counting the future much less than many investors believe. This is why 
some of the stocks that at ﬁrst glance appear highest priced may, upon 
analysis, be the biggest bargains. 

5.  Don’t quibble over eighths and quarters. 

I have used ﬁctitious examples in attempting to make clear various other 
matters. This time I will use an actual example. A little over twenty years 
ago, a gentleman who in most respects has demonstrated a high order of 
investment ability wanted to buy one hundred shares of a stock listed on 
the New York Stock Exchange. On the day he decided to buy, the stock 
closed at 35½. On the following day it sold repeatedly at that price. But 
this gentleman would not pay 35½. He decided he might as well save ﬁfty 
dollars. He put his order in at 35. He refused to raise it. The stock never 
again sold at 35. Today, almost twenty-ﬁve years later, the stock appears to  
have a particularly bright future. As a result of the stock dividends and splits 
that have occurred in the intervening years, it is now selling at over 500. 

Five Don’ts for Investors 

1 3 3 

In other words, in an attempt to save ﬁfty dollars, this investor failed 
to  make  at  least  $46,500.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  question  that  this 
investor would have made the $46,500, because he still has other shares 
of  this  same  company  which  he  bought  at  even  lower  ﬁgures.  Since 
$46,500 is about 930 times 50, this means that our investor would have 
had to save his ﬁfty dollars 930 times just to break even. Obviously, fol- 
lowing a course of action with this kind of odds against it borders on 
ﬁnancial lunacy. 

This particular example is by no means an extreme one. I purposely 
selected a stock which for a number of years was more of a market lag-
gard than a market leader. If our investor had picked any one of perhaps 
ﬁfty other growth stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, mis-
sing $3500 worth of such stock in order to save $50 would have cost a 
great deal more than the $46,500. 

For the small investor wanting to buy only a few hundred shares of  
a stock, the rule is very simple. If the stock seems the right one and the  
price seems reasonably attractive at current levels, buy “at the  market.” 
The extra eighth, or quarter, or half point that may be paid is insigniﬁ-
cant  compared  to  the  proﬁt  that  will  be  missed  if  the  stock  is  not 
obtained. Should the stock not have this sort of long-range potential, I 
believe the investor should not have decided to buy it in the ﬁrst place. 
For the larger investor, wanting perhaps many thousands of shares, 
the problem is not quite as simple. For all but a very small minority of 
stocks, the available supply is usually sufﬁciently limited that an attempt 
to buy at the market even half of this desired amount could well cause  
a sizable advance in quotations. This sudden price rise might, in turn, 
produce two further effects, both tending to make accumulating a block 
of  this  stock  even  more  difﬁcult. The  price  spurt  by  itself  might  be 
enough to arouse the interest and competition of other buyers. It might 
also cause some of those who have been planning to sell to hold their 
shares off the market with the hope that the rise might continue. What 
then should a large buyer do to meet this situation? 

He should go to his broker or securities dealer. He should disclose  
to him exactly how much stock he desires to buy. He should tell the 
broker to pick up as much stock as possible but authorize him to pass 
up small offerings if buying them would arouse many competitive bids. 
Most important, he should give his broker a completely free hand on 
price up to a point somewhat above the most recent sale. How much 
above should be decided in consultation with the broker or dealer after 

 
1 3 4  

taking into account such factors as the size of the block desired, the nor-
mal activity of the shares, how eager the investor may be for the hold-
ing, and any other special factors that might be involved. 

The  investor  may  feel  he  does  not  have  a  broker  or  dealer  upon 
whom he may rely as having sufﬁcient judgment or discretion to han-
dle something of this sort. If so, he should proceed forthwith to ﬁnd a  
broker  or  dealer  in  whom  such  conﬁdence  can  be  placed. After  all,  
doing exactly this sort of thing is the primary function of a broker or  
the trading department of a securities dealer.

Five More Don’ts  
for Investors

1.  Don’t overstress diversiﬁcation. 

No investment principle is more widely acclaimed than diversiﬁcation. 
(Some cynics have hinted that this is because the concept is so simple 
that even stock brokers can understand it!) Be that as it may, there is very 
little chance of the average investor being inﬂuenced to practice insuf- 
ﬁcient  diversiﬁcation. The  horrors  of  what  can  happen  to  those  who 
“put all their eggs in one basket” are too constantly being expounded. 
Too few people, however, give sufﬁcient thought to the evils of the 
other extreme. This is the disadvantage of having eggs in so many bas-
kets that a lot of the eggs do not end up in really attractive baskets, and  
it is impossible to keep watching all the baskets after the eggs get put 
into them. For example, among investors with common stock holdings 
having a market value of a quarter to a half million dollars, the percent- 
age who own twenty-ﬁve or more different stocks is appalling. It is not 
this number of twenty-ﬁve or more which itself is appalling. Rather it 
is that in the great majority of instances only a small percentage of such 
holdings is in attractive stocks about which the investor or his advisor 
has  a  high  degree  of  knowledge.  Investors  have  been  so  oversold  on 
diversiﬁcation  that  fear  of  having  too  many  eggs  in  one  basket  has  
caused them to put far too little into companies they thoroughly know 
and far too much in others about which they know nothing at all. It 
never seems to occur to them, much less to their advisors, that buying a 
company without having sufﬁcient knowledge of it may be even more 
dangerous than having inadequate diversiﬁcation.

How much diversiﬁcation is really necessary and how much is dan- 
gerous? It is somewhat like infantrymen stacking riﬂes. A riﬂeman can-
not get as ﬁrm a stack by balancing two riﬂes as he can by using ﬁve  
or six properly placed. However, he can get just as secure a stack with 
ﬁve  as  he  could  with  ﬁfty.  In  this  matter  of  diversiﬁcation,  however,  
there is one big difference between stacking riﬂes and common stocks. 
With  riﬂes,  the  number  needed  for  a  ﬁrm  stack  does  not  usually  
depend on the kind of riﬂe used. With stocks, the nature of the stock 
itself has a tremendous amount to do with the amount of diversiﬁca- 
tion actually needed. 

Some companies, such as most of the major chemical manufactur- 
ers,  have  a  considerable  degree  of  diversiﬁcation  within  the  company 
itself. While all of their products may be classiﬁed as chemicals, many of 
these chemicals may have most of the attributes found in products from 
completely  different  industries.  Some  may  have  completely  different 
manufacturing problems. They may be sold against different competi- 
tion to different types of customers. Furthermore at times when only 
one  type  of  chemical  is  involved,  the  customer  group  may  be  such  a 
broad section of industry that a considerable element of internal diver- 
siﬁcation may still be present. 

The  breadth  and  depth  of  a  company’s  management  personnel— 
that is, how far a company has progressed away from one-man manage- 
ment—are also important factors in deciding how much diversiﬁcation 
protection  is  intrinsically  needed.  Finally,  holdings  in  highly  cyclical 
industries—that is, those that ﬂuctuate sharply with changes in the state 
of the business cycle—also inherently require being balanced by some-
what  greater  diversiﬁcation  than  do  shares  in  lines  less  subject  to  this 
type of intermittent ﬂuctuation. 

This  difference  between  the  amount  of  internal  diversiﬁcation 
found in stocks makes it impossible to set down hard and fast rules as to 
the minimum amount of diversiﬁcation the average investor requires for 
optimum results. The relationship between the industries involved will 
also  be  a  factor.  For  example,  an  investor  with  ten  stocks  in  equal 
amounts,  but  eight  of  them  bank  stocks,  may  have  completely  inade-
quate diversiﬁcation. In contrast, the same investor with each of his ten 
stocks in a completely different industry may have far more diversiﬁca- 
tion than he really needs. 

Recognizing, therefore, that each case is different and that no pre-
cise rules can be laid down, the following is suggested as a rough guide 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 3 7 

to what might be considered as minimum diversiﬁcation needs for all but 
the very smallest type of investor: 

A. All investments might be conﬁned solely to the large entrenched 
type  of  properly  selected  growth  stock,  of  which  Dow,  Du  Pont,  and 
IBM have already been mentioned as typical examples. In this event, the 
investor  might  have  a  minimum  goal  of  ﬁve  such  stocks  in  all. This  
means  that  he  would  not  invest  over  20  per  cent  of  his  total  original 
commitment in any one of these stocks. It does not mean that should 
one  grow  more  rapidly  than  the  rest,  so  that  ten  years  later  he  found  
40 per cent of his total market value in one stock, he should in any sense 
disturb  such  a  holding. This  assumes,  of  course,  that  he  has  gotten  to 
know his holding and the future continues to look at least as bright for 
these stocks as has the recent past. 

An investor using this guide of 20 per cent of his original invest-
ment for each company should see that there is no more than a mod-
erate amount of overlapping, if any, between the product lines of his ﬁve 
companies. Thus, for example, if Dow were one of his ﬁve companies 
there would seem to me to be no reason why Du Pont might not be 
another. There are relatively few places where the product lines of these 
two companies overlap or compete. If he were to have Dow and some 
other company closer to Dow in its ﬁelds of activity, his purchase might  
still  be  a  wise  one  provided  he  had  sufﬁcient  reason  for  making  it.  
Having  these  two  stocks  in  similar  lines  of  activity  might  prove  very 
proﬁtable  over  the  years.  However,  in  such  an  instance  the  investor 
should keep in mind that his diversiﬁcation is essentially inadequate, and 
therefore he should be alert for troubles which might affect the indus-
try involved. 

B.  Some  or  all  of  his  investments  might  fall  into  the  category  of 
stocks about midway between the young growth companies with their 
high degree of risk and the institutional type of investment described 
above. These would be companies with a good management team rather 
than one-man management. They would be companies doing a volume  
of business somewhere between ﬁfteen and one hundred million dollars 
a year and rather well entrenched in their industries. At least two of such 
companies  should  be  considered  as  necessary  to  balance  each  single 
company  of  the  A  type.  In  other  words,  if  only  companies  in  this  B 
group were involved, an investor might start out with 10 per cent of his 
available  funds  in  each. This  would  make  a  total  of  ten  stocks  in  all. 
However, companies in this general classiﬁcation can vary considerably 

 
1 3 8  

among themselves as to their degree of risk. It might be prudent to con-
sider those with the greater inherent risk as candidates for 8 per cent of 
original  investment,  rather  than  10  per  cent.  In  any  event,  looking  to 
each stock of this class as a candidate for 8 to 10 per cent of total orig-
inal  investment—in  contrast  to  20  per  cent  for  the  A  group—should 
again provide the framework for adequate minimum diversiﬁcation. 

Companies  of  this  B  group  are  usually  somewhat  harder  for  the 
investor to recognize than those of the A or institutional type. There-
fore it might be worthwhile to furnish a brief description of one or two 
such  companies  which  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  rather 
closely and which could be considered typical examples. 

Let us see what I said about such companies in the original edition 
and  how  they  appear  today. The  ﬁrst  B  company  to  which  I  referred  
was P. R. Mallory. I said: 

“P.  R.  Mallory  &  Co.,  Inc.,  enjoys  a  surprising  degree  of  internal 
diversiﬁcation. Its principal products are components for the electronic 
and  electrical  industries,  special  metals,  and  batteries.  For  its  more 
important product lines it is a major factor in the respective industries, 
and in a few of them it is the largest producer. Many of its product lines, 
such  as  electronic  components  and  special  metals,  serve  some  of  the 
most rapidly growing segments of American industry, giving indications 
that Mallory’s growth should continue. In ten years sales have increased 
almost four-fold to a volume of about $80,000,000 in 1957, with about 
one-third of this increase resulting from carefully planned outside acqui- 
sitions and about two-thirds from internal growth. 

“Proﬁt margins over this period have been a bit lower than would 
normally be considered satisfactory for a company of this B group, but 
part  of  this  is  attributable  to  above-average  expenditures  on  research. 
More signiﬁcantly, steps have been taken which are beginning to show 
indications of important improvement in this factor. Management has 
demonstrated  considerable  ingenuity  under  a  dynamic  president,  and 
in  recent  years  has  been  increasing  importantly  in  depth.  Mallory  
shares  enjoyed  about  a  ﬁve-fold  increase  in  value  during  the  ten-year 
period of 1946 to 1956, frequently selling around ﬁfteen times current 
earnings. 

“Perhaps investment-wise one of the most important factors about 
Mallory lies not within the company itself but in its anticipated one-
third interest in the Mallory-Sharon Metals Corporation. This company 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 3 9 

is  being  planned  as  a  combination  of  the  Mallory-Sharon Titanium 
Corporation—half  of  which  is  owned  by  P.  R.  Mallory  &  Co.,  and 
which has already proved to be an interesting venture for Mallory—and 
National  Distillers’  operations  in  the  raw-material  stages  of  the  same  
industry.  This  new  company  gives  indication  of  being  one  of  the 
lowest-cost  integrated  titanium  producers  and  as  such  should  play  a 
major role in the probable growth of this young industry. Meanwhile  
the corporation in 1958 is expected to start its ﬁrst commercially sig- 
niﬁcant zirconium product and has within its organization considerable 
know-how in other commercially new “wonder metals” such as tanta- 
lum and columbium. This partially owned company gives indications of 
becoming a world leader in not one but a series of metals that promise 
to play a growing part in the atomic, chemical, and guided-missile age  
of tomorrow. As such it could be an asset of tremendous dollar signiﬁ-
cance to increase the growth that appears inherent in Mallory itself.”

If I were writing these words today, slightly over two years later, I 
would write them somewhat differently. I would tone down moderate- 
ly my enthusiasm for the possible contributions of the one-third owned 
Mallory-Sharon Metals Corporation. I think everything I said two years 
ago  could  still  occur.  However,  particularly  so  far  as  titanium  is  con-
cerned, I believe it may take longer to ﬁnd and develop sizable markets 
for this metal than had seemed to be the case two years ago. 

On the other hand, I would be inclined to strengthen my words for 
the Mallory company itself by about the degree I would weaken them 
for  its  afﬁliate. The  trend  I  mentioned  of  increasing  management  in 
depth has progressed importantly during this period. While Mallory, as 
a component supplier to the durable goods industry, is in a line of busi-
ness  that  is  bound  to  feel  the  ravages  of  any  major  general  slide,  the 
management showed unusual adroitness in adjusting to 1958 conditions 
and held earnings to $1.89 per share against the all-time peak of $2.06  
the year before. Earnings came back fast in 1959 and promise to make 
new records for the full year somewhere around $2.75 per share. Fur- 
thermore these earnings are being established in the face of decreasing 
but  still  heavy  costs  for  certain  of  the  newer  divisions. This  showing  
gives  promise  that  if  general  economic  conditions  remain  reasonably 
prosperous, signiﬁcant further growth in proﬁts will be seen in 1960. 

Mallory stock is one of the few examples cited in this book that to 
date  has  done  worse  rather  than  better  than  the  market  as  a  whole.  

 
1 4 0  

Although I suspect this company has been more successful than some of  
its competitors in meeting Japanese competition in the electronic com- 
ponents phases of its business, this threat may be a reason for the rela-
tively  poor  market  action. Another  reason  may  be  lack  of  interest  by 
much of the ﬁnancial community in a business that is not easily classi- 
ﬁed in one industry or another, but cuts across several. This may change 
in time, particularly as awareness grows that its miniature battery lines  
are  not  so  far  removed  from  some  glamorous  growth  ﬁelds,  for  they 
should grow with the steady trend toward miniaturization in electronics. 
At any rate, this stock which was at 35 when the ﬁrst edition was writ-
ten, after allowing for two 2 per cent stock dividends since, is now sell-
ing at 37¼. 

Now  let  us  see  what  I  said  about  the  other  B  group  example  I 

discussed in the original edition: 

“The Beryllium Corporation is another good example of a group  
B investment. The corporate title of this company has a young-company 
implication  that  causes  uninformed  people  to  assume  that  the  stock  
carries with it a greater degree of risk than may actually exist. A low-
cost producer, it is the only integrated company making master alloys  
of beryllium copper and beryllium aluminum and also operating a fab- 
ricating  plant  in  which  the  master  alloy  is  turned  into  rod,  bar,  strip, 
extrusions,  etc.,  and,  in  the  case  of  tools,  into  ﬁnished  products.  Sales 
have  increased  about  six  times  during  the  ten-year  period  ending  in 
1957 to a total of approximately $16,000,000. A growing percentage of 
these  sales  is  to  electronic,  computing  machine,  and  other  industries 
promising  rapid  growth  in  the  years  ahead. With  important  new  uses 
such as beryllium copper dies just beginning to be of sales importance, 
it would seem that the good growth rate of the past ten years may be 
just  an  indication  of  what  is  to  come. This  would  tend  to  justify  the 
price-earnings  ratio  of  around  20  at  which  this  stock  has  frequently  
sold in the past ﬁve years. 

“Indicating that this growth may continue for many years to come, 
the Rand Corporation, brilliant research arm of the Air Force owned  
by  the  government,  has  been  quoted  in  the  press  as  predicting  an 
important future in the 1960’s for the as yet almost non-existent ﬁeld  
of  beryllium  metal  as  a  structural  material. The  Rand  Corporation, 
among other things correctly foretold, shortly after the war, the devel-
opment in titanium. 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 4 1 

“More immediate than any eventual market that may develop for 
beryllium as a structural material, 1958 should see this company bring 
into volume production another brand-new product. This is beryllium 
metal  for  atomic  purposes. This  product,  being  made  in  a  completely 
separate plant from the older master-alloy lines, is under long-term con-
tract to the Atomic Energy Commission. It gives indications of having 
a big future in the nuclear industry where demand will probably occur 
from  both  government  and  private  industry  sources.  Management  is 
alert. In fact, this company qualiﬁes rather favorably under our ﬁfteen 
points in regard to all aspects but one, where the deﬁciency is realized 
and steps have already been started to correct it.”

As in the case of Mallory, the past two years have brought both plus- 
es and minuses to the picture I portrayed at that time. However, the favor- 
able developments seem to have by far outweighed the unfavorable, as 
should be the case if a company is to prove the right sort of investment. 
On the unfavorable side, the prospects for beryllium copper dies, men-
tioned two years before, appear to have lost much of their luster and the 
long-term growth curve of the entire alloy end of the business may be 
somewhat  less  brisk  than  indicated  in  that  description.  Meanwhile,  
nuclear demand for beryllium metal over the next few years appears to be 
somewhat less now than it was then. However, possibly far outbalancing 
this, there are steadily increasing signs that there may be a most dramatic 
growth in the demand for beryllium metal for many types of airborne pur- 
poses. The start of this demand is already here. It is appearing in so many 
places and for so many different kinds of products that no one is safe in pre- 
dicting what its limitations may be. This may not prove quite as favorable 
as might otherwise be judged, for it may make the ﬁeld so attractive as to 
bring threats of a major competitive technological breakthrough from 
some company not now in the ﬁeld. However, fortunately, the company  
may have made major strides in strengthening itself in the only one of our 
ﬁfteen points where it had been weak. This was in its research activities. 

How has the stock responded to all this? When the ﬁrst edition was 
written it was at 16.16, after allowing for the  various stock dividends 
that have been paid since. Today it is at 26½, a gain of 64 per cent. 

A few other companies, with which I am somewhat less familiar but 
which I believe have management, trade position, growth prospects, and 
other characteristics which easily qualify them as good examples of this 
B  group  are  Foote  Minerals  Company,  Friden  Calculating  Machine  

 
1 4 2  

Co., Inc., and Sprague Electric Company. Each of these companies has 
proven a highly desirable investment for those who have held the shares 
for a period of years. Sprague Electric roughly quadrupled in value dur-
ing the 1947–1957 period. Friden stock was ﬁrst offered to the public  
in 1954, but in less than three years it had increased about two and a half 
times in market value. By 1957 it was selling at better than four times 
the price at which blocks of stock are believed to have changed hands 
privately about a year prior to this public offering. These price increases, 
satisfactory  as  they  might  appear  to  most  investors,  were  relatively  
minor  compared  to  what  has  happened  to  the  shares  of  the  Foote  
Minerals  Company.  This  stock  was  listed  on  the  New York  Stock 
Exchange early in 1957. Prior to that time the stock was traded over the 
counter and was ﬁrst available to the public in 1947. At that time the 
stock  was  selling  at  about  $40  per  share.  Due  to  stock  dividends  and 
split-ups the investor who purchased 100 shares at the time of the orig-
inal ﬁnancing in 1947 and held on now has over 2400 shares. The stock 
recently sold at approximately $50. 

C. Finally there are the small companies with staggering possibili- 
ties of gain for the successful, but complete or almost complete loss of 
investment  for  the  unsuccessful.  I  have  already  pointed  out  elsewhere 
why I believe the amount, if any, of such securities in an investment list 
should vary according to the circumstances and goals of the particular  
investor.  However,  there  are  two  good  rules  to  follow  in  regard  to 
investments of this type. One has already been mentioned. Never put  
any  funds  into  them  that  you  cannot  afford  to  lose. The  other  is  that 
larger investors should never at the time of the original investment put 
over 5 per cent of available funds into any one such company. As point- 
ed out elsewhere, one of the risks of the small investor is that he may be 
too small to obtain the spectacular prospects of this type of investment 
and still get the beneﬁts of proper diversiﬁcation. 

In the original edition, I referred to Ampex as it was in 1953 and 
Elox in 1956 as examples of the huge-potential but high-risk compa- 
nies that fall into the C classiﬁcation. How have these companies done 
since? Elox, which was at 10 when the ﬁrst edition was completed, is  
at 7 5
8 today. In contrast, Ampex’s market performance continues bril- 
liant  and  demonstrates  why  once  an  outstanding  management  has  
proven  itself  and  fundamental  conditions  have  not  changed,  shares  
should never be sold just because the stock has had a huge rise and may 
seem temporarily high priced. In the discussion on research in Chapter 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 4 3 

Three,  I  mentioned  that  in  the  ﬁrst  four  years  following  the  offering 
of this stock to the public in 1953, it had risen 700 per cent. When I 
ﬁnished the original edition, it was at 20.* Today with sales and earn- 
ings  up  dramatically  year  after  year  and  with  80  per  cent  of  today’s  
sales in products that were not in existence only four years ago, it is at 
107½. This is a gain of 437 per cent in just over two years. It is a gain  
of  over  3500  per  cent  in  six  years.  In  other  words,  $10,000  placed  in 
Ampex in 1953 would have a market value of over $350,000 today in  
a  company  with  a  proven  ability  to  score  one  technical  and  business 
triumph after another. 

Other situations with which I am less familiar but which might well 
fall  in  this  category  were  Litton  Industries,  Inc.,  when  its  shares  were  
ﬁrst offered to the public, and Metal Hydrides. However, one charac- 
teristic of this type of company should be kept in mind from the stand-
point of diversiﬁcation. They entail so much risk and offer such prom-
ising prospects that, in time, one of two things usually happens. Either 
they  fail,  or  else  they  grow  in  trade  position,  management  depth,  and 
competitive  strength  to  a  point  where  they  can  be  classiﬁed  in  the  B 
rather than the C group. 

When  this  has  happened,  the  shares  held  in  them  usually  have 
advanced so spectacularly in market price that, depending on what has 
happened to the value of an investor’s other holdings during the period, 
they  may  then  represent  a  considerably  greater  per  cent  of  the  total  
portfolio than they formerly did. However, B stocks are so much safer 
than C stocks that they may be retained in greater volume without sac- 
riﬁcing proper diversiﬁcation. Therefore, if the company has changed in 
this way, there is seldom reason to sell stock—at least not on the ground 
that the market rise has resulted in this company representing too great 
a percentage of total holdings. 

This change from a C to a B company is, for example, exactly what 
happened during the 1956–1957 period in the case of Ampex. As the 
company tripled in size and proﬁts rose even faster, and as the market  
for its magnetic recorders and the components thereof broadened into 
more  and  more  growth  industries,  this  company  grew  in  intrinsic 
strength  to  a  point  where  it  could  be  classiﬁed  in  the  B group.  It  no 
longer  carried  with  it  the  element  of  extreme  investment  risk. When  
this  point  had  been  reached,  a  considerably  larger  percentage  of  total 

*After allowing for the 2½-to-l stock split that has since occurred. 

 
1 4 4  

investment  might  be  held  in  Ampex  without  violating  principles  of 
prudent diversiﬁcation. 

All the above percentages represent merely a minimum or prudent 
standard of diversiﬁcation. Going below this limit is a bit like driving an 
automobile above normal speeds. A driver doing this may get where he 
wants to go sooner than he otherwise would. However, he should keep 
in mind that he is driving at a rate requiring extra alertness and vigi-
lance. Forgetting this, he may not only fail to arrive at his destination 
more quickly—he may never get there at all. 

How  about  the  other  side  of  the  coin?  Is  there  any  reason  an 
investor  should  not  have  more  diversiﬁcation  than  something  resem-
bling the minimum amounts mentioned? There is no reason whatsoever, 
as long as the additional holdings are ones which appear equivalent in 
attractiveness  to  this  minimum  number  of  holdings  in  regard  to  two 
matters. These  additional  securities  should  be  equivalent  to  the  other 
holdings in regard to the degree of growth which appears attainable in 
relation to the risks involved. They should also be equivalent in regard 
to the investor’s ability to keep in touch with and follow his investment, 
once  he  has  made  it.  However,  practical  investors  usually  learn  their 
problem is ﬁnding enough outstanding investments, rather than choos-
ing among too many. The occasional investor who does ﬁnd more such 
unusual companies than he really needs seldom has the time to keep in 
close enough touch with all additional corporations. 

Usually  a  very  long  list  of  securities  is  not  a  sign  of  the  brilliant 
investor, but of one who is unsure of himself. If the investor owns stock 
in so many companies that he cannot keep in touch with their man- 
agements  directly  or  indirectly,  he  is  rather  sure  to  end  up  in  worse  
shape  than  if  he  had  owned  stock  in  too  few  companies. An  investor 
should always realize that some mistakes are going to be made and that 
he  should  have  sufﬁcient  diversiﬁcation  so  that  an  occasional  mistake 
will  not  prove  crippling.  However,  beyond  this  point  he  should  take 
extreme care to own not the most, but the best. In the ﬁeld of common 
stocks, a little bit of a great many can never be more than a poor sub- 
stitute for a few of the outstanding. 

2.  Don’t be afraid of buying on a war scare. 

Common stocks are usually of greatest interest to people with imagina- 
tion. Our imagination is staggered by the utter horror of modern war. 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 4 5 

The result is that every time the international stresses of our world pro-
duce either a war scare or an actual war, common stocks reﬂect it. This  
is a psychological phenomenon which makes little sense ﬁnancially. 

Any  decent  human  being  becomes  appalled  at  the  slaughter  and 
suffering  caused  by  the  mass  killings  of  war.  In  today’s  atomic  age,  
there is added a deep personal fear for the safety of those closest to us 
and for ourselves. This worry, fear, and distaste for what lies ahead can  
often  distort  any  appraisal  of  purely  economic  factors. The  fears  of  
mass  destruction  of  property,  almost  conﬁscatory  higher  taxes,  and 
government  interference  with  business  dominate  what  thinking  we 
try to do on ﬁnancial matters. People operating in such a mental cli-
mate are inclined to overlook some even more fundamental economic 
inﬂuences. 

The results are always the same. Through the entire twentieth cen-
tury, with a single exception, every time major war has broken out any-
where in the world or whenever American forces have become involved 
in any ﬁghting whatever, the American stock market has always plunged 
sharply  downward.  This  one  exception  was  the  outbreak  of  World  
War  II  in  September  1939.  At  that  time,  after  an  abortive  rally  on 
thoughts of fat war contracts to a neutral nation, the market soon was 
following the typical downward course, a course which some months  
later  resembled  panic  as  news  of  German  victories  began  piling  up. 
Nevertheless,  at  the  conclusion  of  all  actual  ﬁghting—regardless  of 
whether it was World War I, World War II, or Korea—most stocks were 
selling at levels vastly higher than prevailed before there was any thought 
of war at all. Furthermore, at least ten times in the last twenty-two years, 
news has come of other international crises which gave threat of major 
war.  In  every  instance,  stocks  dipped  sharply  on  the  fear  of  war  and 
rebounded sharply as the war scare subsided. 

What do investors overlook that causes them to dump stocks both 
on the fear of war and on the arrival of war itself, even though by the 
end of the war stocks have always gone much higher than lower? They 
forget that stock prices are quotations expressed in money. Modern war 
always causes governments to spend far more than they can possibly col-
lect from their taxpayers while the war is being waged. This causes a vast 
increase in the amount of money, so that each individual unit of money, 
such as a dollar, becomes worth less than it was before. It takes lots more 
dollars to buy the same number of shares of stock. This, of course, is the 
classic form of inﬂation. 

 
1 4 6  

In other words, war is always bearish on money. To sell stock at the 
threatened  or  actual  outbreak  of  hostilities  so  as  to  get  into  cash  is  
extreme ﬁnancial lunacy. Actually just the opposite should be done. If an 
investor has about decided to buy a particular common stock and the 
arrival  of  a  full-blown  war  scare  starts  knocking  down  the  price,  he  
should ignore the scare psychology of the moment and deﬁnitely begin 
buying.  This  is  the  time  when  having  surplus  cash  for  investment 
becomes  least,  not  most,  desirable.  However,  here  a  problem  presents 
itself. How fast should he buy? How far down will the stock go? As long 
as the downward inﬂuence is a war scare and not war, there is no way  
of knowing. If actual hostilities break out, the price would undoubted- 
ly go still lower, perhaps a lot lower. Therefore, the thing to do is to buy 
but buy slowly and at a scale-down on just a threat of war. If war occurs, 
then increase the tempo of buying signiﬁcantly. Just be sure to buy into 
companies either with products or services the demand for which will 
continue  in  wartime,  or  which  can  convert  their  facilities  to  wartime 
operations. The great majority of companies can so qualify under today’s 
conditions of total war and manufacturing ﬂexibility. 

Do stocks actually become more valuable in war time, or is it just 
money which declines in value? That depends on circumstances. By the 
grace of God, our country has never been defeated in any war in which 
it  has  engaged.  In  war,  particularly  modern  war,  the  money  of  the 
defeated  side  is  likely  to  become  completely  or  almost  worthless,  and 
common stocks would lose most of their value. Certainly, if the United 
States were to be defeated by Communist Russia, both our money and 
our stocks would become valueless. It would then make little difference 
what investors might have done. 

On the other hand, if a war is won or stalemated, what happens to 
the real value of stocks will vary with the individual war and the indi- 
vidual  stock.  In World War  I,  when  the  enormous  prewar  savings  of 
England and France were pouring into this country, most stocks prob-
ably increased their real worth even more than might have been the case 
if the same years had been a period of peace. This, however, was a one-
time condition that will not be repeated. Expressed in constant dollars— 
that  is,  in  real  value—American  stocks  in  both World War  II  and  the 
Korean period undoubtedly did fare less well than if the same period 
had  been  one  of  peace. Aside  from  the  crushing  taxes,  there  was  too 
great a diversion of effort from the more proﬁtable peace-time lines to 
abnormally  narrow-margin  defense  work.  If  the  magniﬁcent  research 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 4 7 

effort spent on these narrow-margin defense projects could have been 
channelled to normal peace-time lines, stockholders’ proﬁts would have 
been far greater—assuming, of course, that there would still have been 
a free America in which any proﬁts could have been enjoyed at all. The 
reason for buying stocks on war or fear of war is not that war, in itself, 
is ever again likely to be proﬁtable to American stockholders. It is just 
that money becomes even less desirable, so that stock prices, which are 
expressed in units of money, always go up. 

3.  Don’t forget your Gilbert and Sullivan. 

Gilbert and Sullivan are hardly considered authorities on the stock mar-
ket. Nevertheless, we might keep in mind their “ﬂowers that bloom in 
the  spring,  tra-la”  which,  they  tell  us,  have “nothing  to  do  with  the  
case.” There  are  certain  superﬁcial  ﬁnancial  statistics  which  are  fre-
quently  given  an  undeserved  degree  of  attention  by  many  investors. 
Possibly it is an exaggeration to say that they completely parallel Gilbert 
and Sullivan’s ﬂowers that bloom in the spring. Instead of saying they 
have nothing to do with the case, we might say they have very little to 
do with it. 

Foremost among such statistics are the price ranges at which a stock 
has sold in former years. For some reason, the ﬁrst thing many investors 
want  to  see  when  they  are  considering  buying  a  particular  stock  is  a  
table giving the highest and lowest price at which that stock has sold in 
each  of  the  past  ﬁve  or  ten  years. They  go  through  a  sort  of  mental 
mumbo-jumbo,  and  come  up  with  a  nice  round  ﬁgure  which  is  the 
price they are willing to pay for the particular stock. 

Is  this  illogical?  Is  it  ﬁnancially  dangerous? The  answer  to  both 
questions is emphatically yes. It is dangerous because it puts the empha-
sis on what does not particularly matter, and diverts attention from what 
does  matter. This  frequently  causes  investors  to  pass  up  a  situation  in 
which they would make big proﬁts in order to go into one where the 
proﬁts will be much smaller. To understand this we must see why the 
mental process is so illogical. 

What makes the price at which a stock sells? It is the composite esti- 
mate  at  that  moment  of  what  all  those  interested  think  the  corrective 
value of such shares may be. It is the composite appraisal of the outlook 
for  this  company  by  all  potential  buyers  and  sellers,  weighted  by  the 
number of shares each buyer or seller is disposed to bid for or offer, in 

 
1 4 8  

relation to a similar appraisal, at the same moment, of the outlook for 
other  companies  with  their  individual  prospects.  Occasionally,  some-
thing  like  forced  liquidation  will  produce  a  moderate  deviation  from  
this ﬁgure. This happens when a large holder presses stock on the mar-
ket  for  reasons—such  as  liquidating  an  estate  or  paying  off  a  loan— 
which may not be directly related to the seller’s view of the real value 
of the shares. However, such pressures usually cause only moderate vari-
ation from the composite appraisal of the prevailing price of the shares, 
since bargain hunters normally step in to take advantage of the situation, 
which thereby adjusts itself. 

The point which is of real signiﬁcance is that the price is based on 
the current appraisal of the situation. As changes in the affairs of the com-
pany become known, these appraisals become correspondingly more or 
less  favorable.  In  relation  to  other  stocks,  these  particular  shares  then 
move  up  or  down.  If  the  factors  appraised  were  judged  correctly,  the 
stock becomes permanently more or less valuable in relation to other  
stocks. The shares then stay up or down. If more of these same factors 
continue to develop, they in turn are recognized by the ﬁnancial com- 
munity. The stock then goes and stays either further up or down, as the 
case may be. 

Therefore, the price at which the stock sold four years ago may have 
little  or  no  real  relationship  to  the  price  at  which  it  sells  today. The 
company may have developed a host of able new executives, a series of 
new and highly proﬁtable products, or any number of similar desirable 
attributes that make the stock intrinsically worth four times as much in 
relation to the price of other stocks as it was worth four years ago. The 
company might have fallen into the hands of an inefﬁcient management 
and slipped so badly in relation to competition that the only way recov-
ery could occur would be through the raising of much new capital. This 
might force such a dilution of the shares that the stock today could not 
possibly be worth more than a quarter of the price of four years ago. 

Against this background, it can be seen why investors so frequently 
pass up stocks which would have brought them huge future gains, for 
ones where the gain is very much smaller. By giving heavy emphasis to 
the “stock that hasn’t gone up yet” they are unconsciously subscribing  
to the delusion that all stocks go up about the same amount and that  
the  one  that  has  already  risen  a  lot  will  not  climb  further,  while  the 
one  that  has  not  yet  gone  up  has  something “due”  it.  Nothing  could 
be further from the truth. The fact that a stock has or has not risen in 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 4 9 

the  last  several  years  is  of  no  signiﬁcance  whatsoever  in  determining 
whether it should be bought now. What does matter is whether enough 
improvement has taken place or is likely to take place in the future to 
justify importantly higher prices than those now prevailing. 

Similarly,  many  investors  will  give  heavy  weight  to  the  per-share 
earnings of the past ﬁve years in trying to decide whether a stock should 
be bought. To look at the per-share earnings by themselves and give the 
earnings of four or ﬁve years ago any signiﬁcance is like trying to get 
useful  work  from  an  engine  which  is  unconnected  to  any  device  to 
which that engine’s power is supposed to be applied. Just knowing, by 
itself,  that  four  or  ﬁve  years  ago  a  company’s  per-share  earnings  were 
either four times or a quarter of this year’s earnings has almost no sig- 
niﬁcance in indicating whether a particular stock should be bought or 
sold. Again,  what  counts  is  knowledge  of  background  conditions. An 
understanding of what probably will happen over the next several years 
is of overriding importance. 

The investor is constantly being fed a diet of reports and so-called 
analyses  largely  centered  around  these  price  ﬁgures  for  the  past  ﬁve 
years. He should keep in mind that it is the next ﬁve years’ earnings, not 
those of the past ﬁve years, that now matter to him. One reason he is 
fed such a diet of back statistics is that if this type of material is put in a 
report it is not hard to be sure it is correct. If more important matters 
are gone into, subsequent events may make the report look quite silly. 
Therefore, there is a strong temptation to ﬁll up as much space as pos-
sible  with  indisputable  facts,  whether  or  not  the  facts  are  signiﬁcant. 
However, many people in the ﬁnancial community place emphasis on 
this type of prior years’ statistics for a different set of reasons. They seem 
to be unable to grasp how great can be the change in just a few years’ 
time in the real value of certain types of modern corporations. There-
fore they emphasize these past earnings records in a sincere belief that 
detailed accounting descriptions of what happened last year will give a 
true picture of what will happen next year. This may be true for certain 
classes  of  regulated  companies  such  as  public  utilities.  For  the  type  of 
enterprise which I believe should interest an investor desiring the best  
results for his money, it can be completely false. 

A striking example of this centers around events with which I had 
the good fortune to be quite familiar. In the summer of 1956, an oppor- 
tunity arose to buy a fair-sized block of shares in Texas Instruments, Inc., 
from its principal ofﬁcers who were also its largest stockholders. Careful 

 
1 5 0  

study of this company revealed that it rated not just well but magniﬁ- 
cently in regard to our ﬁfteen-point test. Reason for the ofﬁcers to sell 
appeared entirely legitimate; this occurs frequently in true growth com- 
panies. Their  holdings  had  already  advanced  so  much  that  several  of  
them  had  become  millionaires  so  far  as  their  holdings  in  their  own 
company were concerned. In contrast, their other assets were relatively 
negligible. Therefore, particularly since they were selling but a tiny part 
of the shares they owned, some diversiﬁcation seemed entirely in order. 
The ever-present possibility of estate tax liability alone would be sufﬁ-
cient to make such a course prudent from the standpoint of these key 
executives, regardless of the future of their company. 

At any rate, negotiations were completed to acquire these shares at 
a price of 14. This represented twenty times the anticipated 1956 per-
share earnings of about 70¢. To anyone who gave particular weight to  
past  statistics,  this  seemed  well  beyond  the  bounds  of  prudence.  Per- 
share earnings had been reported at 39¢, 40¢, 48¢, and 50¢ for the prior 
four  years  of  1952  to  1955  respectively—hardly  an  exciting  growth 
record.  Even  more  depressing  to  those  who  subordinate  the  more 
important factors of management and current business trends to super-
ﬁcial statistical comparisons, the company, through a corporate acquisi- 
tion, had obtained the beneﬁts of some loss carry-forward, which had 
made possible subnormal income tax charges during much of this period. 
This made any price calculated on the basis of past statistics seem even  
higher. Finally, even if 1956 earnings were included in an evaluation, a 
superﬁcial study of this situation might still have produced grave fore- 
bodings. True, the company was currently doing remarkably well in the 
promising  ﬁeld  of  transistors.  But  regardless  of  the  obviously  glowing 
future  for  the  semi-conductor  industry  as  a  whole,  how  long  could  a 
company of this size be expected to maintain its strong trade position 
against  the  larger  and  older  companies,  with  much  stronger  balance 
sheets, which were sure to make a major competitive effort to partici- 
pate in the great growth that lay ahead for transistors? 

When the usual SEC channels reported this ofﬁcers selling, a rash 
of  heavy  trading  broke  out  in Texas  Instruments  shares  with  relative- 
ly  little  change  in  price.  Much  of  this  selling,  I  suspect,  was  induced  
by  various  brokerage  comments  that  appeared.  Most  of  these  fur- 
nished  the  past  statistical  record  and  commented  on  the  historically  
high price, the competition that lay ahead, and the inside selling. One 
such  bulletin  went  so  far  as  to  express  complete  agreement  with  the 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 5 1 

management  of Texas  Instruments.  It  reported  the  ofﬁcers  were  sel- 
ling  and  stated:  “We  agree  with  them  and  recommend  the  same  
course!” The  major  buyer  during  this  period,  I  have  been  told,  was  a 
large and well-informed institution. 

What happened in the next twelve months? Texas Instruments’geo- 
physical  and  military  electronic  business,  overlooked  in  the  ﬂurry  of 
controversy, continued to grow. The semi-conductor (transistor) division 
grew even more rapidly. More important than the growth in transistor  
volume  were  the  great  strides  taken  by  this  able  management  in 
research, in plans for mechanization, and in building up the distribution 
organization in this key semi-conductor ﬁeld. As evidence piled up that 
1956  results  were  not  a  ﬂash  in  the  pan  but  that  this  relatively  small  
company would continue as one of the largest and lowest cost producers 
in what promises to be one of the fastest growing segments of American  
industry,  the  ﬁnancial  community  began  revising  upward  the  price- 
earnings ratio it would pay for a chance to participate in this well-run 
enterprise. As the summer of 1957 came around and the management 
publicly  estimated  that  year’s  per-share  earnings  at  around  $1.10,  the 
54 per cent growth in earnings had produced in just twelve months an 
approximate 100 per cent increase in market value. 

In the original edition I went on to say: 

“I suspect that if the headquarters of the principal divisions of this  
company were not located in Dallas and Houston, but were situated along 
the northern half of the Atlantic seaboard or in the Los Angeles metropol- 
itan area—where more ﬁnancial analysts and other managers of important 
funds could more easily learn about the company—this price-earnings 
ratio might have gone even higher during this period. If, as appears prob-
able, Texas Instruments’ sales and earnings continue their sharp upward 
trend for some years to come, it will be interesting to see whether this con- 
tinued growth, of itself, does not in time provide some further upward 
change in the price-earnings ratio. If this happens, the stock would again 
go up at an even faster rate than the earnings are advancing, the combina- 
tion which always produces the sharpest increases in share prices.” 

Has this optimistic forecast been conﬁrmed? A look at the record 
may jolt those who still insist that it is possible to appraise an investment 
by a superﬁcial analysis of past earnings and little more. Proﬁts rose from 
$1.11 per share in 1957 to $1.84 in 1958 and give promise of topping 

 
1 5 2  

$3.50 in 1959. Since the ﬁrst edition of this book was completed, the 
company attained honors that were bound to rivet the attention of the 
ﬁnancial community upon it. In 1958, in the face of competition from 
some of the generally acclaimed giants of the electronics and electrical  
equipment  industry,  International  Business  Machines  Corporation, 
overwhelmingly the largest electronic calculating machine manufactur- 
er in the world, selected Texas Instruments to be its associate for joint 
research  effort  in  the  application  of  semi-conductors  to  this  type  of 
equipment. Again, in 1959 Texas Instruments announced a technologi- 
cal breakthrough whereby it was possible to use semi-conductor mate-
rial of approximately the same size as existing transistors, not alone for 
a transistor but for a complete electronic circuit! What this may bring 
about in the way of miniaturization almost staggers the imagination. As 
the company has grown, its unusually able product research and devel- 
opment  groups  have  increased  proportionately.  Today  few  informed 
people have much doubt that the company’s long series of technical and 
business “ﬁrsts” will continue in the years ahead. 

How has the market price of these shares responded to all this? Has 
the  price-earnings  ratio  continued  to  advance  as,  twenty-two  months 
ago, I indicated appeared probable? The record would appear to be in 
the afﬁrmative. Per-share earnings have a little more than tripled since 
1957. The stock is up over ﬁve times from the price of 26½ at which it 
was  selling  when  the  ﬁrst  edition  was  completed. The  current  price, 
incidentally,  represents  a  gain  of  better  than  1000  per  cent  from  the 
price of 14, which was mentioned in the original edition as the price at 
which a fair-sized block of this stock had been bought less than three 
and one-half years before. In spite of this steep rise it will be interesting 
to see whether further gains in sales and earnings in the years ahead do 
not produce still more worthwhile appreciation. 

This  brings  up  another  line  of  reasoning  which  causes  some 
investors  to  pay  undue  attention  to  these  unrelated  statistics  on  past  
price ranges and per-share earnings. This is the belief that whatever has 
happened  for  a  number  of  years  is  bound  to  continue  indeﬁnitely.  In 
other words, some investors will ﬁnd a stock the per-share earnings and 
market price of which have risen in each of the past ﬁve or ten years. 
They will conclude that this trend is almost certain to continue indeﬁ-
nitely. I will agree that this might happen. But in view of the uncertainty 
in timing the results of research and of the costliness of bringing out the 
new products that make this type of growth possible, it is quite common 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 5 3 

for  even  the  most  outstanding  growth  companies  to  have  occasional 
one- to three-year dips in their rate of earnings. Such dips can produce 
sharp declines in their shares. Therefore, to give emphasis to this kind of 
past earning record, rather than to the background conditions that can 
control the future earning curve, may prove very costly. 

Does  all  this  mean  that  past  earnings  and  price  ranges  should  be 
completely ignored in deciding whether to buy a stock? No. It is only 
when given an importance they do not deserve that they become dan- 
gerous. They are helpful as long as it is realized they are only auxiliary 
tools to be used for specialized purposes and not major factors in decid-
ing the attractiveness of a common stock. Thus, for example, a study of 
per-share earnings for various prior years will throw considerable light 
on how cyclical a stock may be, that is, on how much the company’s 
proﬁts will be affected by the varying stages of the business cycle. More 
important, comparing past per-share earnings with price ranges will fur-
nish the price-earnings ratio at which the stock sold in the past. This 
serves as a base from which to start measuring what the price-earnings 
ratio may be in the future. Here again, however, it must be kept in mind 
that it is the future and not the past which governs. Perhaps the shares  
for years have steadily sold at only eight times earnings. Now, however, 
changes  in  management,  establishment  of  an  outstanding  research 
department, etc., are putting the company into the class that is current- 
ly  selling  around  ﬁfteen  times  earnings  instead  of  eight. Then  anyone 
estimating  future  earnings  and  ﬁguring  the  anticipated  value  of  the 
shares  at  only  eight  instead  of  ﬁfteen  times  earnings  might  again  be 
leaning too heavily on past statistics. 

I  headed  this  subdivision  of  my  comments  “Don’t  forget  your  
Gilbert and Sullivan.” Perhaps I should have headed it “Don’t be inﬂu-
enced by what doesn’t matter.” Statistics of former years’ earnings and 
particularly  of  per-share  price  ranges  of  these  former  years  quite  fre-
quently “have nothing to do with the case.” 

4.  Don’t fail to consider time as well as price in buying  
a true growth stock. 

Let us consider an investment situation that occurs frequently. A compa- 
ny qualiﬁes magniﬁcently as to the standards set up under our ﬁfteen 
points. Furthermore, very important gains in earning power are going to 
appear about a year from now, due to factors about which the ﬁnancial 

 
1 5 4  

community is, as yet, completely unaware. Even more important, there 
are strong indications that these new sources of earnings are going to 
grow importantly for at least several years after that. 

Under normal circumstances this stock would obviously be a buy. 
However, there is a factor that gives us pause. Success of other ventures 
in  prior  years  has  given  this  stock  so  much  glamour  in  the  ﬁnancial 
world that if it were not for these new and generally unknown inﬂu-
ences,  the  stock  might  be  considered  to  be  reasonably  priced  around  
20  and  out  of  all  reason  at  its  present  price  of  32. Assuming  that  ﬁve  
years  from  now  these  new  inﬂuences  could  easily  cause  it  to  be  fully 
worth 75, should we, right now, pay 32—or 60 per cent more than we 
believe the stock is worth? There is always the chance that these new 
developments might not turn out to be as good as we think. There is 
also the possibility that this stock might sink back to what we consider 
its real value of 20. 

Confronted with this situation, many conservative investors would 
watch  quotations  closely.  If  the  stock  got  near  20  they  would  buy  it 
eagerly. Otherwise they would leave the shares alone. This happens often 
enough to be worthy of somewhat closer analysis. 

Is  there  anything  sacred  about  our  ﬁgure  of  20?  No,  because  it 
admittedly  does  not  take  into  consideration  an  important  element  of 
future value—the factors we know and most others don’t know which 
we believe will in a few years justify a price of 75. What is really impor-
tant here is to ﬁnd a way that we can buy the stock at a price close to 
the low point at which it will sell from here on in. Our concern is that  
if we buy at 32, the stock may subsequently go somewhere around 20. 
This  would  not  alone  cause  us  a  temporary  loss.  More  signiﬁcant,  it 
would mean that if the stock subsequently went to 75, we would have 
for our money only about 60 per cent of the shares that we could have 
gotten if we had waited and bought at 20. Assuming that in twenty years 
still  other  new  ventures  would  have  given  these  shares  a  value  not  of 
75 but of 200, this factor of the total number of shares we could have 
obtained for our money would prove extremely important. 

Fortunately,  in  a  situation  of  this  sort  there  is  another  guide-post 
which may be relied on, even if some of my friends in the insurance  
and banking worlds seem to regard it as about as safe as trying to walk 
over water. This is to buy the shares not at a certain price, but at a cer-
tain date. From a study of other successful ventures carried through in 
the past by this same company, we can learn that these ventures were 

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 5 5 

reﬂected in the stock’s price at a particular point in their development. 
Perhaps it averaged about one month before these ventures reached the 
pilot-plant  stage. Assuming  that  our  company’s  shares  are  still  selling 
around  32,  why  not  plan  to  buy  these  shares  ﬁve  months  from  today, 
which will be just one month before the pilot plant goes on stream? Of 
course, the shares can still go down after that. However, even if we had 
bought these shares at 20, there would have been no positive guarantee 
against a further drop. If we have a fair chance of buying at about as low 
a price as possible, aren’t we accomplishing our objective, even if we feel 
that  on  the  basis  of  the  publicly  known  factors  the  stock  should  be 
lower? Under these circumstances, isn’t it safer to decide to buy at a cer-
tain date rather than a certain price? 

Fundamentally, this approach does not ignore the concept of value 
at all. It only appears to ignore it. Except for the probability that there 
would be a far greater increase in value coming in the future, it would 
be just as illogical as some of my ﬁnancial friends claim it to be to decide 
to buy on a speciﬁc future date rather than at a speciﬁc price. However, 
when the indications are strong that such an increase is coming, decid-
ing the time you will buy rather than the price at which you will buy 
may bring you a stock about to have extreme further growth at or near 
the lowest price at which that stock will sell from that time on. After all, 
this  is  exactly  what  you  should  be  trying  to  do  when  you  make  any 
stock purchase. 

5.  Don’t follow the crowd. 

There is an important investment concept which is frequently difﬁcult 
to understand without considerable ﬁnancial experience. This is because 
its explanation does not lend itself easily to precise wording. It does not 
lend itself at all to reduction to mathematical formulae. 

Time and again throughout this book I have touched upon differ- 
ent inﬂuences that have resulted in a common stock going up or down 
in price. A change in net income, a change in a company’s management, 
appearance of a new invention or a new discovery, a change in interest 
rates or tax laws—these are but a few random examples of conditions 
that will bring about a rise or fall in the quotations for a particular com-
mon  stock. All  these  inﬂuences  have  one  thing  in  common. They  are  
real  occurrences  in  the  world  about  us. They  are  actions  which  have  
happened  or  are  about  to  happen.  Now  we  come  to  a  very  different 

 
1 5 6  

type of price inﬂuence. This is a change which is purely psychological. 
Nothing has changed in the outside or economic world at all. The great 
majority of the ﬁnancial community merely look upon the same cir- 
cumstances  from  a  different  viewpoint  than  before. As  a  result  of  this 
changed  way  of  appraising  the  same  set  of  basic  facts,  they  make  a 
changed appraisal of the price or the price-earnings ratio they will pay 
for the same shares. 

There  are  fads  and  styles  in  the  stock  market  just  as  there  are  in 
women’s clothes. These can, for as much as several years at a time, pro-
duce  distortions  in  the  relationship  of  existing  prices  to  real  values  
almost as great as those faced by the merchant who can hardly give away 
a  rack  full  of  the  highest  quality  knee-length  dresses  in  a  year  when 
fashion decrees that they be worn to the ankle. Let me give a speciﬁc 
example: In 1948 I was chatting with a gentleman whom I believe to 
be an able investment man. He has served as president of the New York  
Society of Security Analysts, a position which is usually awarded only to 
the more able in the ﬁnancial community. At any rate, I had just arrived 
in  New York  from  a  visit  to  the  headquarters  of  the  Dow  Chemical 
Company at Midland, Michigan. I mentioned that earnings for the ﬁs- 
cal year just closing would be at new high levels and that I thought the 
stock was a real buy. He replied that he felt it was of historic and per-
haps statistical interest that a company such as Dow could ever earn this 
much per share. He felt, however, that these earnings did not make the 
stock attractive, since it was obvious that the company was enjoying a 
temporary postwar boom that could not last. He further explained that 
he  felt  it  was  impossible  to  judge  the  real  value  of  stocks  of  this  sort  
until  there  had  occurred  the  same  type  of  postwar  depression  that 
within  a  few  years  followed  the  Civil War  and World War  I.  His  rea- 
soning,  unfortunately,  completely  ignored  all  the  potential  further 
increase in value to this stock promised by the many new and interest- 
ing products the company was then developing. 

That in no future year did Dow’s earnings fall anywhere near as low 
as this supposedly abnormal peak is not what should concern us here. 
Neither is the fact that from this supposedly high plateau at which it was 
then selling, the stock has since climbed many hundreds per cent. Our 
interest should be in why this normally able investment man would take 
this set of facts and derive from it a quite different conclusion as to the 
intrinsic value of the stock than he would have derived from the same 
facts in some other year.

The answer is that for these three years, from 1947 to 1949, almost 
the whole ﬁnancial community was indulging in a mass delusion. With 
all the ease of hindsight we can now sit back and see that what appeared 
so frightening then was almost as little related to reality as the terror that  
gripped  most  of  Christopher  Columbus’s  crew  in  1492.  Night  after  
night most of the common seamen on the Santa Maria were unable to 
sleep because of a paralyzing fear that at any moment their ship would 
fall off the ends of the earth and be lost forever. In 1948, the investment 
community  gave  little  value  to  the  earnings  of  any  common  stock  
because  of  the  widespread  conviction  that  nothing  could  prevent  the 
near future bringing the same type of bitter depression and major stock 
market crash that happened about the same number of years after each  
of the two preceding major wars. In 1949, a slight depression did occur. 
When  its  modest  nature  was  appraised  and  the  ﬁnancial  community  
found that the subsequent trend was up, not down, a tremendous psy- 
chological change occurred in the way common stocks were regarded. 
Many common stocks more than doubled in price in the following few 
years, due to nothing more than this psychological change. Those com-
mon stocks which also had the beneﬁt of more tangible outside occur-
rences improving their fundamental worth did a great deal better than 
just doubling. 

These great shifts in the way the ﬁnancial community appraises the 
same set of facts at different times are by no means conﬁned to stocks 
as a whole. Particular industries and individual companies within those 
industries  constantly  change  in  ﬁnancial  favor,  due  as  often  to  altered 
ways of looking at the same facts as to actual background occurrences 
themselves. 

For  example,  in  certain  periods  the  armament  industry  has  been 
considered unattractive by the investment community. One of its most 
outstanding characteristics has been considered to be domination by a 
single customer, the government. This customer in some years goes in 
for heavy military procurement, and in others cuts buying way down. 
Therefore the industry never knows from one year to the next when  
it  may  be  subject  to  major  contract  cancellations  and  drying  up  of 
business. 

To  this  must  be  added  the  abnormally  low  profit  margin  that 
customarily  prevails  in  government  work,  and  the  tendency  of  the 
renegotiation  laws  to  take  most  of  what  profit  is  made,  but  never  
correspondingly  to  allow  for  a  mistake  in  calculations  that  causes  a  

 
1 5 8  

loss. Furthermore, the constant necessity to keep bidding on new mod-
els in a ﬁeld where engineering changes come continuously means that 
risk and turmoil are the order of the day. It is impossible, no matter how 
good your engineering, to standardize anything that gives your compa- 
ny a long-term advantage over the aggressive competition. Finally, there 
is always the “danger” that peace might break out with an accompany- 
ing decline in business. When this view prevails, as it has many times in 
the past twenty years, the defense shares sell at a quite low price in rela-
tion to their earnings. 

However,  the  ﬁnancial  community  has  at  times  in  the  recent  past 
derived other conclusions from the same set of facts. The world situa-
tion is such that the need of heavy expenditures for airborne defense 
equipment will be with us for years. While the total value may vary from 
year to year, the pace of engineering change is causing more and more 
expensive equipment to be needed, so that the long-range trend will be 
upward. This means that the happy investor in these securities will be in 
one of the few industries which will in no sense feel the next business 
depression, which sooner or later will be felt by most other industries. 
While the proﬁt margin is limited by law, so much business is available 
to the well-run company that this proves no ceiling upon total net prof-
its. When this view prevails, a quite different appraisal is being given to 
exactly the same background facts. These stocks then sell on a quite dif- 
ferent basis. 

Examples could be given for industry after industry which in the past 
twenty years has been looked upon ﬁrst one way, then another, by the 
ﬁnancial community, with a resultant change in quoted values. In 1950, 
pharmaceutical stocks were generally regarded as having about the same 
set  of  desirable  characteristics  usually  credited  to  industrial  chemical 
companies. Endless growth due to the wonders of research and a steady 
rise in the standard of living seemed to warrant the best of these shares 
selling at the same ratio to earnings as the best of the chemicals. Then a 
single manufacturer got into trouble on a heretofore glamorous item. The 
realization swept the ﬁnancial community that this was a ﬁeld in which 
dominance today is no assurance of being even one of the top compa- 
nies  tomorrow. A  reappraisal  of  the  entire  industry  took  place.  Com-
pletely different price-earnings ratios prevailed, due, in all cases but one, 
not to a different set of facts but a different appraisal of the same facts. 

In 1958, just the reverse took place. In the business slump of that  
year,  one  of  the  few  industries  that  enjoyed  increased  rather  than  

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 5 9 

decreased demand for its products was the drug manufacturing indus- 
try. Proﬁts of most companies in this group rose to new highs. At the 
same  time  earnings  of  the  chemical  producers  fell  rather  sharply— 
largely because of excess capacity from major expansion moves that had 
just  been  completed. The  volatile  ﬁnancial  community  again  started 
sharply  upgrading  the  price-earnings  ratio  of  drug  shares.  Meanwhile 
sentiment started to grow that the chemical stocks were not as attrac-
tive as had previously been supposed. All this represented only changed 
ﬁnancial appraisals. Nothing of fundamental or intrinsic consideration 
had happened. 

A year later, some of this new sentiment had already been reversed. 
As the better chemical companies proved among the ﬁrst to recover lost 
earning power and as their growth trend caused proﬁts soon to go to 
new all-time high levels, they rather quickly regained their temporarily 
lost prestige. With the long-range signiﬁcance of an ever-growing num-
ber of important new drugs tending further to bolster the status of the 
pharmaceutical  stocks  as  against  governmental  attacks  on  pricing  and  
patent policies of this industry working in the opposite direction, it will 
be interesting to observe over the next several years whether the recent- 
ly regained standing of the pharmaceutical stocks grows still further or 
starts to shrink. 

In the original edition I went on to give one (then) current exam-

ple of this same sort of changed ﬁnancial appraisal, by saying: 

“One  more  example  is  a  change  in  outlook  that  is  taking  place 
right now. For years the shares of the machine tool manufacturers have 
sold at a very low ratio to earnings. It was almost unanimously felt that 
machine tools were the epitome of a feast or famine industry. No mat-
ter  how  good  such  earnings  were,  they  did  not  mean  much  because  
they  were  just  the  product  of  a  prevailing  boom  and  could  not  last. 
Recently,  however,  a  new  school,  while  by  no  means  predominating  
the  thinking  on  this  subject,  has  been  gaining  converts. This  school 
believes that since World War II a fundamental change has taken place 
affecting these companies. All industry has been swinging from short- 
to long-range planning of capital expenditures. As a result, the cause of 
extreme  ﬂuctuation  for  the  machine  tool  companies  has  disappeared. 
High and rising wage rates will prevent for many years, if not forever,  
a return to the feast or famine nature of this business. The steady pace  
of engineering advance has increased and will further increase the pace 

 
1 6 0  

of  obsolescence  of  this  industry’s  products. Therefore,  in  place  of  the 
largely cyclical prewar trends, the growth trend of the recent past will 
continue  further  into  the  future. Automation  may  cause  this  growth 
trend to be spectacular. 

“Under  the  inﬂuence  of  those  who  think  this  way,  the  better 
machine tool stocks are now appraised on a somewhat more favorable 
basis  in  relation  to  the  market  as  a  whole  than  they  were  only  a  few 
years  ago. They  still  sell  at  a  rather  low  ratio  to  earnings  because  the 
inﬂuence of the feast or famine idea is still  strong, even  if it  is not  as 
strong as it used to be. If the ﬁnancial community comes more and more 
to accept this non-cyclical and growth outlook for machine tool stocks, 
their price-earnings ratio will improve more and more. They will then 
do  much  better  than  the  market.  If  the  old  feast  or  famine  concept 
regains its former hold, these shares will sell at a lower ratio to earnings 
than prevails today. 

“This current machine tool example brings into clear relief what the 
common stock investor must do if he is to purchase shares to his great-
est advantage. He must examine factually and analytically the prevailing 
ﬁnancial sentiment about both the industry and the speciﬁc company of 
which he is considering buying shares. If he can ﬁnd an industry or a 
company where the prevailing style or mode of ﬁnancial thinking is con- 
siderably less favorable than the actual facts warrant, he may reap himself 
an extra harvest by not following the crowd. He should be extra careful 
when buying into companies and industries that are the current darlings 
of the ﬁnancial community, to be sure that these purchases are actually 
warranted—as at times they well may be—and that he is not paying a 
fancy price for something which, because of too favorable interpretation 
of basic facts, is the investment fad of the moment.”

Today, of course, we know the answer to the recent ideas of some  
that  the  machine  tool  industry  is  no  longer  feast  or  famine  in  its  
nature. The  1957  recession  completely  exploded  the  idea  that  long-
range  corporate  planning  now  cushions  these  stocks  from  their  nor-
mal  extreme  vulnerability  to  downward  movements  in  the  business 
cycle.  However,  for  every  problem  of  this  sort  which  gets  solved,  the 
ever-increasing  pace  of  today’s  technology  opens  up  a  dozen  others  
from which the wise investor can proﬁt if he can think independent- 
ly  of  the  crowd  and  reach  the  right  answer  when  the  majority  of  
ﬁnancial opinion is leaning the other way. Are the “exotic” fuel stocks  

Five More Don’ts for Investors  

1 6 1 

and  certain  of  the  smaller  electronics  intrinsically  worth  the  high 
appraisals being given them today? Is there such a future for manufac- 
turers  of  ultrasonic  equipment  that  ordinary  price-earnings  may  be 
disregarded?  Is  a  company  better  or  worse  for  the American  investor 
if  an  abnormally  large  part  of  its  earning  power  is  derived  from  for- 
eign  operations? These  are  all  matters  about  which  the  ideas  of  the 
multitude may have swung too far or not far enough right now. If he 
is thinking of participating in the affected companies, the wise investor 
must determine which are fundamental trends that will go further, and 
which are fads of the moment. 

These investment fads and misinterpretations of facts may run for 
several months or several years. In the long run, however, realities not 
only terminate them, but frequently, for a time, cause the affected stocks 
to go too far in the opposite direction. The ability to see through some 
majority opinions to ﬁnd what facts are really there is a trait that can 
bring rich rewards in the ﬁeld of common stocks. It is not easy to develop, 
however, for the composite opinion of those with whom we associate 
is  a  powerful  inﬂuence  upon  the  minds  of  us  all. There  is  one  factor 
which all of us can recognize, however, and which can help powerfully 
in  not  just  following  the  crowd. This  is  realization  that  the  ﬁnancial 
community is usually slow to recognize a fundamentally changed con- 
dition, unless a big name or a colorful single event is publicly associat- 
ed with that change. The ABC Company’s shares have been selling at a 
very low price, in spite of the attractiveness of its industry, because it has 
been badly managed. If a widely known man is put in as the new pres-
ident, the shares will usually not only respond at once, but will proba- 
bly over-respond. This is because the time it takes to bring about basic 
improvement will probably be overlooked in the ﬁrst enthusiasm. How-
ever, if the change to a superb management comes from the brilliance  
of heretofore little-known executives, months or years may go by dur-
ing which the company will still have poor ﬁnancial repute and sell at a 
low ratio to earnings. Recognizing such situations—prior to the price 
spurt that will inevitably accompany the ﬁnancial community’s correc- 
tion of its appraisal—is one of the ﬁrst and simplest ways in which the 
ﬂedgling investor can practice thinking for himself rather than follow- 
ing the crowd.

How I Go about Finding  
a Growth Stock

After the publication of the original edition of Common Stocks and 

Uncommon Proﬁts, I began receiving an amazing, to me, number of 
letters from readers all over the country. One of the most common 
requests  made  was  for  more  detailed  data  about  just  what  an  investor 
(or  his  ﬁnancial  advisor)  should  do  to  ﬁnd  investments  that  will  lead  
to spectacular gains in market price. Since there is so much interest in  
this  matter,  it  may  be  beneﬁcial  to  include  some  comments  on  this 
 subject here. 

Doing  these  things  takes  a  great  deal  of  time,  as  well  as  skill  and 
alertness. The small investor may feel a disproportionate amount of work 
is involved for the sums he has at his disposal. It would be nice, not only 
for him but also for the large investor, if there were some easy, quick way 
of selecting bonanza stocks. I strongly doubt that such a way exists. How 
much  time  should  be  spent  on  these  matters  is,  of  course,  something 
each  investor  must  decide  for  himself  in  relation  to  the  sums  he  has 
available for investment, his interests, and his capabilities. 

I cannot say with any assurance that my method is the only possible 
system for ﬁnding bonanza investments. Nor can I even be completely 
sure that it is the best method although, obviously, if I thought some other  
available approach were better I would not be using this one. For some 
years, however, I have followed the steps I am about to outline in detail; 
doing this has worked and worked well for me. Particularly in the highly 
important earlier stages, someone else with greater background knowl-
edge, better contacts, or more ability might make some important varia-
tions in these methods and attain further improvement in over-all results.

There are two stages in the following outline, at each of which the  
quality  of  the  decisions  made  will  have  tremendous  effect  upon  the 
ﬁnancial  results  obtained.  Everyone  will  recognize  instantly  the  over- 
whelming importance of the decision at the second of these two critical 
points, which is, “Do I now buy this particular stock or do I not?” What 
may not be as easy to recognize is that right at the start of an organized 
method for selecting common stocks, decisions must also be made that 
can have just about as great an impact on the chance of uncovering an 
investment  that  ten  years  later  will  have  increased,  say,  twelve-fold  in 
value one rather than that has not quite doubled. 

This is the problem that confronts anyone about to start on a quest 
for  a  major  growth  security:  there  are  literally  thousands  of  stocks  in 
dozens  of  industries  that  could  conceivably  qualify  as  worthy  of  the  
most intensive study.  You cannot be sure about many of them until con- 
siderable work has been done. However, no one could possibly have the  
time to investigate more than a tiny per cent of the available ﬁeld. How 
do  you  select  the  one  or  the  very  few  stocks  to  the  investigation  of 
which you will devote such time as you have to spare? 

This is a far more complex problem than it seems. You must make 
decisions that can easily screen out from investigation situations that a 
few  years  later  have  produced  fortunes. You  may  make  decisions  that 
limit your work to rather barren soil, in that as you gather more data the  
outlook  appears  more  and  more  clear  that  you  are  approaching  the 
answer you are bound to ﬁnd in the overwhelming majority of all inves- 
tigations. This is that the company is run of the mill or maybe a little  
better, but that it just is not the occasional bonanza that leads to spec- 
tacular  proﬁt. Yet  this  key  decision  determines  whether,  ﬁnancially  
speaking, you are prospecting rich ore or poor on the basis of relatively  
little knowledge of the facts. This is because you must make decisions  
on  what  to  or  what  not  to  spend  your  time  before  you  have  done 
enough  work  to  have  a  proper  basis  for  your  conclusion.  If  you  have 
done  enough  work  to  have  adequate  background  for  your  decisions,  
you  will  have  already  spent  so  much  time  on  each  situation  that,  in 
effect, you will have made this vital ﬁrst decision on a snap basis any- 
way.  You just will not have realized that you have done so. 

Some years ago I would sincerely but mistakenly have told you that 
I  used  what  would  have  sounded  like  a  neat  method  for  solving  this 
problem. As a result of companies which I had already investigated, and 
particularly as a result of familiarity with the companies in which the 

 
1 6 4  

funds I manage were concentrated, I had become friendly with a sizable 
number of quite able business executives and scientists. I could talk to 
these people about companies other than their own. I believed that ideas 
and  leads  furnished  by  such  unusually  well-informed  contacts  would 
provide a magniﬁcent supply of prospects for investigation that would 
contain an abnormally large per cent of companies that might prove to 
have the outstanding characteristics I am constantly seeking. 

However, I attempt to use the same analytical and self-critical meth-
ods of improving the techniques of my own business that I expect the 
companies in which I invest to use to improve their operations. There-
fore, some years ago I made a study to determine two things. How had  
I come to select the companies which I had chosen for investigation? 
With hindsight to help me, were there signiﬁcant variations in the per- 
centage  of  worthwhile  results  (in  the  way  of  outstanding  investments 
subsequently  acquired)  between  investigations  made  as  a  result  of  the 
original “spark plug” idea coming from one type of source and those 
coming from sources of a completely different nature? 

What I found astonished me but is entirely logical on analysis. The 
business executive-scientist classiﬁcation which I had believed was my 
main  source  of  original  ideas  causing  me  to  investigate  one  company 
rather than another, actually had furnished only about one-ﬁfth of the 
leads that had excited me enough to engage in a further study. Of even 
greater signiﬁcance, these leads had not proven an above average source 
of  good  investments. This  one-ﬁfth  of  total  investigations  had  led  to  
only about one-sixth of all worthwhile purchases. 

In contrast, the ﬁrst original idea for almost four-ﬁfths of the inves- 
tigations and almost ﬁve-sixths of the ultimate pay-out (as measured by 
worthwhile  purchases)  had  come  from  a  quite  different  group. Across 
the nation I had gradually come to know and respect a small number of  
men whom I had seen do outstanding work of their own in selecting  
common stocks for growth. A not necessarily complete list of these able  
investment men would include one or more living in such widely scat- 
tered  places  as  New York,  Boston,  Philadelphia,  Buffalo,  Chicago,  San 
Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. In many instances I might not 
agree at all with the conclusions of any of these men as to a stock they 
particularly liked, even to the point of feeling it worthy of investigation. 
In  one  or  two  cases,  I  might  even  consider  the  thoroughness  of  their 
work as suspect. However, because in each case I knew their ﬁnancial 
minds were keen and their records impressive, I would be disposed to 

How I Go about Finding a Growth Stock  

1 6 5 

listen  eagerly  to  details  they  might  furnish  concerning  any  company 
within my range of interests that they considered unusually attractive for 
major appreciation. 

Furthermore, since they were trained investment men, I could usu-
ally get rather quickly their opinion upon the key matters most impor-
tant to me in my decision as to whether it might be a good gamble to 
investigate the company in question. What are these key matters? Essen-
tially  they  cover  how  the  company  would  measure  up  to  our  already 
discussed ﬁfteen points, with special emphasis in this preliminary stage 
on  two  speciﬁc  subjects.  Is  the  company  in,  or  being  steered  toward, 
lines of business affording opportunities of unusual growth in sales? Are 
these lines where, as the industry grows, it would be relatively simple for  
newcomers to start up and displace the leading units? If the nature of  
the  business  is  such  that  there  is  little  way  of  preventing  newcomers  
from entering the ﬁeld, the investment value of such growth as occurs 
may prove rather slight. 

How about using investment men of fewer accomplishments or less 
ability as a source of original leads on what to investigate? If I did not 
feel that better men were available, I doubtless would use them some-
what more than I do. I always try to ﬁnd the time at least to listen once 
to any investment man, if only to be on the alert for keen younger men 
coming up in the business and to be sure I am not overlooking one. 
However, the competition for time is terriﬁc. As I downgrade either a  
ﬁnancial  man’s  investment  judgment  or  his  reliability  as  to  facts  pre-
sented, I ﬁnd my tendency to spend time investigating the company he 
presents decreasing even more than proportionally. 

How about selecting original leads for investigation from the ideas in  
printed  material?  Occasionally  I  have  been  inﬂuenced  by  the  special 
reports issued by the most reliable brokerage houses when these reports are  
not for widespread distribution but solely to a few selected people. How-
ever, on the whole, I would feel the typical public printed brokerage bul- 
letin available to everyone is not a fertile source. There is too much danger 
of inaccuracies in them. More important, most only repeat what is already 
common  knowledge  in  the  ﬁnancial  community.  Similarly,  I  will  occa- 
sionally get a worthwhile idea from the best of the trade and ﬁnancial peri- 
odicals (which I ﬁnd quite helpful for completely different purposes); but 
because I believe they have certain inherent limitations on what they can 
print about many of the matters of greatest interest to me, I do not ﬁnd 
them a rich source of new ideas on the best companies to investigate. 

 
1 6 6  

There is another possible source of worthwhile original leads which 
others  with  better  technical  backgrounds  or  greater  ability  might  be 
able to employ proﬁtably, although I have not successfully done so. This 
source  is  the  major  consulting  research  laboratories  such  as Arthur  D.  
Little, Stanford Research Institute, or Battelle. I have found that person- 
nel of these organizations have great understanding of just the business 
and  technical  developments  from  which  worthwhile  original  invest- 
ment ideas should come. However, I have found the usefulness of this 
group largely blocked by their tendency (which is entirely praiseworthy) 
to be unwilling to discuss most of what they know because it might vio- 
late  the  conﬁdence  of  the  client  companies  for  which  they  have  
worked. If someone smarter than I am could ﬁnd a way, without injury 
to these client companies, of unlocking the mine of investment infor- 
mation I suspect these organizations possess, he might well have found 
a means of importantly improving on my methods regarding this par- 
ticular step in the quest for growth stocks. 

So much for step one. On the basis of a few hours’ conversation, usu- 
ally with an outstanding investment man, occasionally with a business 
executive or scientist, I have made a decision that a particular company 
might be exciting. I will start my investigation. What do I do next? 

There are three things I emphatically do not do. I do not (for rea- 
sons that I think will soon become clear) approach anyone in the man- 
agement at this stage. I do not spend hours and hours going over old  
annual  reports  and  making  minute  studies  of  minor  year-by-year  
changes  in  the  balance  sheet.  I  do  not  ask  every  stockbroker  I  know 
what  he  thinks  of  the  stock.  I  will,  however,  glance  over  the  balance 
sheet to determine the general nature of the capitalization and ﬁnancial 
position. If there is an SEC prospectus I will read with care those parts 
covering breakdown of total sales by product lines, competition, degree 
of ofﬁcer or other major ownership of common stock (this can also usu-
ally  be  obtained  from  the  proxy  statement),  and  all  earning  statement 
ﬁgures  throwing  light  on  depreciation  (and  depletion,  if  any),  proﬁt  
margins,  extent  of  research  activity,  and  abnormal  or  non-recurring  
costs in prior years’ operations. 

Now I am ready really to go to work. I will use the “scuttlebutt” 
method I have already described just as much as I possibly can. Here, 
rather than as a source of original ideas for investment, is where the peo- 
ple I have come to know in the business executive-scientist group can 
be  of  inestimable  value.  I  will  try  to  see  (or  reach  on  the  telephone) 

How I Go about Finding a Growth Stock

every key customer, supplier, competitor, ex-employee, or scientist in a  
related  ﬁeld  that  I  know  or  whom  I  can  approach  through  mutual  
friends. However, suppose I still do not know enough people or do not 
have  a  friend  of  a  friend  who  knows  enough  of  the  people  who  can 
supply me with the required background. What do I do then? 

Frankly, if I am not even close to getting much of the information 
I need, I will give up the investigation and go on to something else. To 
make big money on investments it is unnecessary to get some answer to 
every investment that might be considered. What is necessary is to get 
the right answer a large proportion of the very small number of times 
actual purchases are made. For this reason, if way too little background is 
forthcoming and the prospects for a great deal more are bleak, I believe 
the intelligent thing to do is to put the matter aside and go on to some-
thing else. 

However, suppose quite a bit of background has become available.  
You  have  called  on  everyone  you  know  or  can  readily  approach,  but 
have  spotted  one  or  two  people  who  you  believe  could  do  much  to 
complete your picture if they would talk freely to you. I would not just 
walk in on them off the street. Most people, interested as they may be  
in  the  industry  in  which  they  are  engaged,  are  not  inclined  to  tell  to  
total strangers what they really think about the strong and weak points 
of a customer, a competitor, or a supplier. I would ﬁnd out the com- 
mercial bank of the people I want to meet. If in matters of this sort you 
approach a commercial bank that knows you, tell them frankly whom 
you want to meet and exactly why, it is surprising how obliging most 
commercial bankers will be in trying to help you—provided you do not 
bother them too often. It is possibly even more surprising how helpful 
most businessmen will try to be if you are introduced to them by their 
regular  bankers.  Of  course  this  help  will  only  be  forthcoming  if  the 
bankers in question have no doubt whatsoever that the information you 
are seeking is solely for background purposes in determining whether 
to make an investment, and that under no circumstance would you ever 
embarrass anyone by quoting the source of any derogatory information.  
If you follow these rules, banking help can, at times, help complete the  
stage  of  an  investigation  that  otherwise  might  never  be  complete  
enough to be of any value. 

It is only after “scuttlebutt” has obtained for you a large part of the 
data  that  in  our  chapter  on  the  ﬁfteen  points  I  indicated  can  best  be 
obtained from such sources, that you should be ready to take the next 

 
1 6 8  

step  and  think  about  approaching  the  management.  I  think  it  rather 
important that investors thoroughly understand why this is so. 

Good managements, those most suitable for outstanding invest-
ment, are nearly all quite frank in answering questions about the com- 
pany’s weak points as fully as about its strong points. However, no mat- 
ter  how  punctilious  a  management  may  be  in  this  respect,  no  
corporate ofﬁcer in his own self-interest can be expected, unasked, to 
volunteer some of the most signiﬁcant matters for you, the investor, to 
know. How can a vice president to whom you say, “Is there anything  
else you think I, as a prospective investor, should know about your  
company?” give a reply to the effect that the other top members of the  
management team are doing splendidly but several years of poor work  
by the vice president for marketing is beginning to cause weakness in  
sales? Could he possibly volunteer further that this may not be too 
important,  since  young Williams,  on  the  marketing  staff,  has  out- 
standing ability and in another six months he will be in charge and  
the  situation  brought  back  under  control?  Of  course  he  could  not  
volunteer these things. However, I have found that if he learns you 
already know of the marketing weakness, his remark may be diplo- 
matically worded, but with the right type of management and if they 
have conﬁdence in your judgment, you will be furnished with a real- 
istic answer as to whether anything is or is not being done to remedy 
weaknesses of this type. 

In  other  words,  only  by  having  what “scuttlebutt”  can  give  you  
before  you  approach  management,  can  you  know  what  you  should 
attempt  to  learn  when  you  visit  a  company. Without  it  you  may  be 
unable to determine that most basic of points—the competency of top 
management  itself.  In  even  a  medium-sized  company,  there  may  be  a  
key management team of as many as ﬁve men. You are not apt to meet  
all of them on your ﬁrst or second visit. If you do, you will probably 
meet some for such a short time you will have no basis for determining 
their relative ability. Frequently one or two men of the ﬁve will be far 
more able or far less able than the others. Without “scuttlebutt” to guide 
you, depending on whom you meet you may form far too high or far 
too low an estimate of the entire management. With “scuttlebutt” you 
may have formed a fairly accurate idea of who is particularly strong or 
particularly weak, and are in a better position to ask to meet the specif- 
ic ofﬁcers you may want to know better, thereby satisfying yourself as  
to whether this “scuttlebutt” impression is correct. 

How I Go about Finding a Growth Stock  

1 6 9 

It is my opinion that in almost any ﬁeld nothing is worth doing 
unless it is worth doing right. When it comes to selecting growth stocks, 
the rewards for proper action are so huge and the penalty for poor judg- 
ment is so great that it is hard to see why anyone would want to select 
a growth stock on the basis of superﬁcial knowledge. If an investor or  
ﬁnancial  man  wants  to  go  about  ﬁnding  a  growth  stock  properly,  I 
believe one rule he should always follow is this: he should never visit the  
management of any company he is considering for investment until he 
has ﬁrst gathered together at least 50 per cent of all the knowledge he 
would  need  to  make  the  investment.  If  he  contacts  the  management 
without having done this ﬁrst, he is in the highly dangerous position of 
knowing so little of what he should seek that his chance of coming up 
with the right answer is largely a matter of luck. 

There is another reason I believe it so important to get at least half 
the required knowledge about a company before visiting it. Prominent 
management and managements in companies in colorful industries get  
a  tremendous  number  of  requests  for  their  time  from  people  in  the 
investment  business.  Because  the  price  at  which  their  stock  sells  can  
have so much signiﬁcance to them in so many ways, they will usually 
devote the time of valuable people to such visitors. However, from com- 
pany after company I have heard the same type of comment. To no one 
will they be rude, but the amount of time furnished by key men, rather 
than  by  those  who  receive  ﬁnancial  visitors  but  make  few  executive  
decisions, depends far more on the company’s estimate of the compe-
tence of the visitor than it does on the size of the ﬁnancial interest he 
represents. More important, the degree of willingness to furnish infor- 
mation—that  is,  how  far  the  company  will  go  in  answering  speciﬁc 
questions and discussing vital matters—depends overwhelmingly on this 
estimate of each visitor. Those who just drop in on a company without  
real  advance  preparation,  often  have  two  strikes  against  them  almost 
before the visit starts. 

This matter of whom you see (that it be the men who make the real  
decisions,  rather  than  a  sort  of  ﬁnancial  public  relations  ofﬁcer)  is  so 
important  that  it  is  wise  to  go  to  considerable  trouble  to  be  intro-
duced to management by the right people. An important customer or a  
major stockholding interest known to management can be an excellent  
source of introduction to pave the way for a ﬁrst visit. So can the com- 
pany’s investment banking connections. In any event, those really want-
ing to get optimum results from their ﬁrst visit should make sure that 

 
1 7 0  

those introducing them have a high regard for the visitor and pass the 
reasons for this good opinion on to the management. 

Just  a  few  weeks  prior  to  my  writing  these  words  an  incident 
occurred which may illustrate how much preparation I feel should be 
made prior to a ﬁrst call on management. I was lunching with two rep- 
resentatives  of  a  major  investment  ﬁrm,  one  which  is  the  investment 
banker for two of the handful of companies in which the funds I man-
age are invested. Knowing the small number of situations I go into and 
the long time I normally hold them, one of these gentlemen asked me 
the ratio between the new (to me) companies I visited and the ones of 
these into which I actually bought. I asked him to guess. He estimated  
I  bought  into  one  for  every  two  hundred  and  ﬁfty  visited. The  other 
gentleman ventured that it might be one for every twenty-ﬁve. Actual- 
ly it runs somewhere between one to every two and one to every two 
and  one-half! This  is  not  because  one  out  of  every  two  and  one-half 
companies I look at measures up to what I believe are my rather rigor- 
ous standards for purchase. If he had substituted “companies looked at” 
for “companies  visited”  perhaps  one  in  forty  or  ﬁfty  might  be  about 
right.  If  he  had  substituted “companies  considered  as  possibilities  for 
investigation”  (whether  I  actually  investigated  them  or  not)  then  the 
original estimate of one stock bought for every two hundred and ﬁfty 
considered would be rather close to the mark. What he had overlooked 
was that I believe it so impossible to get much beneﬁt from a plant visit 
until a great deal of pertinent “scuttlebutt” work has been done ﬁrst, and 
that I have found that “scuttlebutt” so many times furnishes an accurate 
forecast of how well a company will measure up to my ﬁfteen points, 
that usually by the time I am ready to visit the management there will 
be at least a fair chance that I will want to buy into the company. A great 
many of the less attractive situations will have been weeded out along 
the way. 

This about sums up how I go about ﬁnding growth stocks. Possi- 
bly  one-ﬁfth  of  my  ﬁrst  investigations  start  from  ideas  gleaned  from 
friends in industry and four-ﬁfths from culling what I believe are the 
more  attractive  selections  of  a  small  number  of  able  investment  men. 
These decisions are frankly a fast snap judgment on which companies 
I should spend my time investigating and which I should ignore. Then 
after a brief scrutiny of a few key points in an SEC prospectus, I will  
seek “scuttlebutt” aggressively, constantly working toward how close to  
our  ﬁfteen-point  standard  the  company  comes.  I  will  discard  one  

How I Go about Finding a Growth Stock  

1 7 1 

prospective investment after another along the way. Some because the 
evidence  piles  up  that  they  are  just  run  of  the  mill.  Others  because  I  
cannot get enough evidence to be reasonably sure one way or the other. 
Only in the occasional case when I have a great amount of favorable 
data do I then go to the ﬁnal step of contacting the management. Then 
if  after  meeting  with  management  I  ﬁnd  my  prior  hopes  pretty  well 
conﬁrmed and some of my previous fears eased by answers that to me 
make  sense,  at  last  I  am  ready  to  feel  I  may  be  rewarded  for  all  my  
efforts. 

Because I have heard them so many times, I know the objections a  
few of you will make to this approach. How can anyone be expected to  
spend this amount of time ﬁnding just one investment? Why are not the  
answers  already  neatly  worked  out  for  me  by  the  ﬁrst  person  in  the 
investment  business  to  whom  I  ask  what  I  should  buy?  I  would  ask  
those  with  this  reaction  to  look  at  the  world  around  them.  In  what 
other line of activity could you put $10,000 in one year and ten years 
later (with only occasional checking in the meantime to be sure man- 
agement continues of high caliber) be able to have an asset worth from 
$40,000 to $150,000? This is the kind of reward gained from selecting 
growth stocks successfully. Is it either logical or reasonable that  anyone 
could do this with an effort no harder than reading a few simply worded 
brokers’  free  circulars  in  the  comfort  of  an  armchair  one  evening  a  
week? Does it make sense that anyone should be able to pick up this 
type of proﬁt by paying the ﬁrst investment man he sees a commission  
of  $135,  which  is  the  New York  Stock  Exchange  charge  for  buying  
500 shares of stock at $20 per share? So far as I know, no other ﬁelds of 
endeavor offer these huge rewards this easily. Similarly, they cannot be 
made in the stock market unless you or your investment advisor utilize 
the same traits that will bring large rewards in any other ﬁeld of activity.  
These  are  great  effort  combined  with  ability  and  enriched  by  both  
judgment  and  vision.  If  these  attributes  are  employed  and  something 
fairly close to the rules laid down in this chapter are used to ﬁnd com-
panies measuring well on our ﬁfteen-point standard but not yet enjoy-
ing  as  much  status  in  the  ﬁnancial  community  as  such  an  appraisal  
would warrant, the record is crystal clear that fortune-producing growth 
stocks can be found. However, they cannot be found without hard work 
and they cannot be found every day.

Summary and Conclusion

We are starting the second decade of a half century that may well 

see the standard of living of the human race advance more than 
it has in the preceding ﬁve thousand years. Great have been the 
investment risks of the recent past. Even greater have been the ﬁnancial 
rewards for the successful. However, in this ﬁeld of investment, the risks 
and rewards of the past hundred years may be small beside those of the 
next ﬁfty. 

In these circumstances it may be well to take stock of our situation. 
We almost certainly have not conquered the business cycle. We may not 
even have tamed it. Nevertheless, we have added certain new factors that 
signiﬁcantly affect the art of investment in common stocks. One of these 
is the emergence of modern corporate management, with all that this  
has done to strengthen the investment characteristics of common shares. 
Another is the economic harnessing of scientiﬁc research and develop- 
mental engineering. 

The emergence of these factors has not changed the basic principles 
of successful common stock investment. It has made them more impor- 
tant than ever. This book has attempted to show what these basic prin- 
ciples are, what type of stock to buy, when to buy it, and most particu- 
larly, never to sell it—as long as the company behind the common stock 
maintains the characteristics of an unusually successful enterprise. 

It is hoped that those sections dealing with the most common mis- 
takes  of  many  otherwise  able  investors  will  prove  of  some  interest.  It 
should  be  remembered,  however,  that  knowing  the  rules  and  under- 
standing these common mistakes will do nothing to help those who do

not have some degree of patience and self-discipline. One of the ablest 
investment men I have ever known told me many years ago that in the 
stock  market  a  good  nervous  system  is  even  more  important  than  a  
good  head.  Perhaps  Shakespeare  unintentionally  summarized  the  
process of successful common stock investment: “There is a tide in the 
affairs of men which, taken at the ﬂood, leads on to fortune.”

CONSERVATIVE   
INVESTORS SLEEP  
WELL

All of my business life, I have believed that the success of my own busi-
ness—or any business—depends on following the principles of two I’s  
and  an  H. These  principles  are  integrity,  ingenuity,  and  hard  work.  I 
would  like  to  dedicate  this  book  to  my  three  sons  in  the  belief  that 
Arthur and Ken are following the principles of the two I’s and an H in 
businesses very similar to mine, as is Don in one that is quite different. 

Introduction

While  these  things  are  hard  to  measure  precisely,  indications  are 

overwhelming  that  only  once  before  in  this  century  has  the 
morale of the American investor been at anything like the low 
ebb that exists as these words are being written. The well-known and 
much publicized Dow Jones Industrial Average is an excellent indicator  
of  the  day-to-day  change  in  stock-market  levels.  However,  when  a  
longer period is under consideration, this average may mask rather than 
reveal  the  full  extent  of  the  injuries  suffered  by  many  who  have  held 
common  stocks  in  the  recent  past.  One  index  that  purports  to  show 
what has happened to all publicly traded common stocks but that does 
not weigh each stock issue by the number of shares outstanding shows 
the average stock in mid-1974 down 70 percent from its 1968 peak.

Faced with this kind of loss, large groups of investors have acted in  
completely predictable ways. One group has pulled out of stocks com-
pletely. Yet many corporations are doing surprisingly well. In an envi- 
ronment  where  more  and  more  inﬂation  appears  inevitable,  properly 
selected  stocks  may  be  far  less  risky  than  some  other  placements  that 
appear safer.There is an even larger group that is of particular interest: 
people who have decided that “from now on we will act more conserv- 
atively.” The  usual  rationale  here  is  to  conﬁne  purchases  only  to  the  
largest  companies,  the  names  of  which  at  least  are  known  to  almost 
everyone. There  are  probably  few  investors  in  the  United  States  and 
almost none in the Northeast who do not know the names Penn Central 
and Consolidated Edison or the nature of these companies’ services. By  
conventional standards, Penn Central some years ago and Consolidated 

1 7 7

1 7 8  

Edison more recently were considered conservative investments. Unfor- 
tunately, often there is so much confusion between acting conservative- 
ly and acting conventionally that for those truly determined to conserve 
their  assets,  this  whole  subject  needs  considerable  untangling—which 
should start with not one deﬁnition but two: 

1.  A  conservative  investment  is  one  most  likely  to  conserve  (i.e.,   

maintain) purchasing power at a minimum of risk. 

2.  Conservative  investing  is  understanding  of  what  a  conservative 
investment  consists  and  then,  in  regard  to  speciﬁc  investments,   
following  a  procedural  course  of  action  needed  properly  to 
determine whether speciﬁc investment vehicles are, in fact, con- 
servative investments. 

Consequently, to be a conservative investor, not one but two things 
are required either of the investor or of those whose recommendations 
he is following. The qualities desired in a conservative investment must 
be understood. Then a course of inquiry must be made to see if a par- 
ticular investment so qualiﬁes. Without both conditions being present the  
buyer of common stocks may be fortunate or unfortunate, conventional 
in his approach or unconventional, but he is not being conservative. 

It seems to me of overriding importance that confusion on matters 
such as these be swept aside for all time to come. Not only stockhold- 
ers themselves but also the American economy as a whole cannot afford 
ever again to have those who make a sincere effort to understand the rules 
suffer the type of bloodbath recently experienced by this generation of 
investors—a bloodletting exceeded only by that which another genera- 
tion  experienced  in  the  Great  Depression  some  forty  years  earlier. 
America today has unparalleled opportunities for improving the way of  
life for all its people. It certainly has the technical knowledge and the 
know-how  to  do  so.  However,  to  do  these  things  in  the  traditional 
American way will require some genuine re-education as to the basic 
fundamentals for a great many investors as well as for many of those in 
the investment industry itself. Only if many more investors come to feel 
ﬁnancially secure because they truly are secure will there be a reopen-
ing of the markets for new stock issues that will enable companies legit-
imately requiring additional equity funds to be in a position to secure 
them on a basis conducive to going ahead with new projects. If this does 
not happen, all that is left is to try to go ahead with what needs to be 

Introduction 

1 7 9 

done in the way that, both here and abroad, has always proven so costly, 
wasteful, and inefﬁcient—by government ﬁnancing, with management 
under the dead hand of bureaucratic ofﬁcialdom. 

For  these  reasons  I  believe  that  the  investors’  problems  of  today 
should be met head on and forthrightly. In an attempt to deal with these  
problems in this book, I have leaned heavily on the counsel of my son, 
Ken, who contributed the title as well as many other matters, including 
part  of  the  basic  conception  of  what  lies  herein.  I  cannot  adequately 
acknowledge his assistance in this presentation. 

This book is divided into four distinct sections. The ﬁrst deals with 
the anatomy—if the word may be used—of a conservative stock invest-
ment as delineated in deﬁnition number one. The second analyzes the 
part played by the ﬁnancial community—the mistakes, if you will—that 
helped produce the current bear market. This critique was not intend- 
ed  merely  to  throw  rocks  but  to  point  out  that  similar  errors  can  be 
avoided  in  the  future  and  that  certain  basic  investment  principles  
become clear when the mistakes of the recent past are studied. The third 
section deals with the course of action that must be taken to qualify as  
conservative investing as delineated in deﬁnition number two. The ﬁnal 
section deals with some of the inﬂuences rampant in today’s world that  
have  caused  grave  doubts  in  the  minds  of  many  as  to  whether  any  
common stock is a suitable means for preserving assets—in other words, 
whether for anything other than as gambling vehicles common stocks 
should  be  considered  at  all. This  book  will,  I  hope,  throw  light  on 
whether the problems that helped produce the recent bear market have 
created a condition where stock ownership is just a trap for the unwary 
or  whether,  as  in  every  prior  major  bear  market  in  U.S.  history,  they  
have created a magniﬁcent opportunity for those with the ability and 
the self-discipline to think for themselves and to act independently of 
the popular emotions of the moment.

The First Dimension  
of a Conservative  
Investment

Superiority in Production, Marketing,
Research, and Financial Skills

Acorporation of the size and type to provide a conservative invest-

ment  is  necessarily  a  complex  organization. To  understand  what 
must be present in such an investment we might start by portray- 
ing  one  dimension  of  the  characteristics  we  must  be  sure  exist. This 
dimension breaks down into four major subdivisions: 

LOW-COST PRODUCTION 

To be a truly conservative investment a company—for a majority if not 
for all of its product lines—must be the lowest-cost producer or about 
as low a cost producer as any competitor. It must also give promise of 
continuing to be so in the future. Only in this way will it give its own-
ers a broad enough margin between costs and selling price to create two 

1 8 0

The First Dimension of a Conservative Investment   

1 8 1 

vital conditions. One is sufﬁcient leeway below the break-even point of  
most competition. When a bad year hits the industry, prices are unlike- 
ly to stay for long under this break-even point. As long as they do, loss- 
es for much of the higher-cost competition will be so great that some 
of  these  competitors  will  be  forced  to  cease  production. This  almost 
automatically increases the proﬁts of the surviving low-cost companies 
because they beneﬁt from the increased production that comes to them 
as they take over demand formerly supplied by the closed plants. The 
low-cost company will beneﬁt even more when the decreased supply 
from competitors enables it not only to do  more business  but also to 
increase prices as excess supplies stop pressing on the market. 

The second condition is that the greater than average proﬁt margin  
should enable a company to earn enough to generate internally a sig- 
niﬁcant part or perhaps all of the funds required for ﬁnancing growth. 
This  avoids  much  or  even  all  of  the  need  for  raising  additional  long-
term capital that can (a) result in new shares being issued and diluting 
the value of already outstanding shares and/or (b) create an additional 
burden of debt, with ﬁxed interest payments and ﬁxed maturities (which 
must  largely  be  met  from  future  earnings)  which  greatly  increase  the 
risks of the common-stock owners. 

However, it should be realized that, just as the degree to which a 
company is a low-cost producer increases the safety and conservatism of 
the investment, so in a boom period in a bullish market does it decrease 
its speculative appeal. The percentage that proﬁts rise in such times will 
always be far greater for the high-cost, risky, marginal company. Simple 
arithmetic will explain why. Let us take an imaginary example of two 
companies of the same size that, when times were normal, were selling 
widgets at ten cents apiece. Company A has a proﬁt of four cents per 
widget  and  Company  B  of  one  cent.  Now  let  us  suppose  that  costs 
remain the same but a temporary extra demand for widgets pushes up 
the price to twelve cents, with both companies remaining the same size. 
The strong company has increased proﬁts from four cents per widget to 
six cents, a gain of 50 percent, but the high-cost company has made a 
300 percent proﬁt gain, or tripled its proﬁts. This is why, short-range, the 
high-cost company sometimes goes up more in a boom and also why, a  
few  years  later,  when  hard  times  come  and  widgets  fall  back  to  eight 
cents,  the  strong  company  is  still  making  a  reduced  but  comfortable 
proﬁt. If the high-cost company doesn’t go bankrupt, it is likely to pro-
duce another crop of badly hurt investors (or perhaps speculators who 

 
1 8 2  

thought they were investors) who are sure something is wrong with the 
system rather than with themselves. 

All of the above has been written with manufacturing companies in  
mind;  hence  the  term  production  has  been  used.  Many  companies,  of 
course, are not manufacturers but are in service lines, such as wholesal-
ing, retailing or one of the many subdivisions of the ﬁnancial world such 
as banking or insurance. The same principles apply, but the word opera-
tions is substituted for production and a low- or high-cost operator for a 
low- or high-cost producer. 

STRONG MARKETING ORGANIZATION 

A strong marketer must be constantly alert to the changing desires of its 
customers so that the company is supplying what is desired today, not 
what used to be desired. At the turn of the century, for example, there 
was something wrong with the marketing efforts of a leading manufac- 
turer  of  horse-drawn  buggies  if  it  persisted  in  trying  to  compete  by  
making ﬁner and ﬁner buggies rather than turning to automobiles or 
going out of business altogether. To bring our example up to date, per-
haps  well  before  the Arab  oil  embargo  made  every  home  in America 
aware that large automobiles were big gas guzzlers, there was something 
wrong with the segment of the automobile industry that failed to rec- 
ognize the ever-increasing popularity of small imported compacts as a 
sign that public demand was swinging toward a product that cost less, 
was cheaper to operate, and was easier to park than the larger, ﬂashier 
models that for so many years had been favorites. 

But recognizing changes in public taste and then reacting promptly 
to these changes is not enough. As has been said before, in the business 
world customers simply do not beat a path to the door of the man with 
the better mousetrap. In the competitive world of commerce it is vital 
to make the potential customer aware of the advantages of a product or  
service. This awareness can be created only by understanding what the  
potential  buyer  really  wants  (sometimes  when  the  customer  himself 
doesn’t  clearly  recognize  why  these  advantages  appeal  to  him)  and 
explaining it to him not in the seller’s terms but in his terms. 

Whether this is best done by advertising, by salesmen making calls,  
by specialized independent marketing organizations, or by any combi- 
nation  of  these  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  business.  But  what  is  

The First Dimension of a Conservative Investment   

1 8 3 

required  in  every  instance  is  close  control  and  constant  managerial  
measurement of the cost effectiveness of whatever means are used. Lack 
of outstanding management in these areas can result (a) in losing a sig- 
niﬁcant  volume  of  business  that  would  otherwise  be  available;  (b)  in 
having  much  higher  costs  and  therefore  obtaining  smaller  proﬁt  on 
what business is obtained; and (c) because of companies’ having varia- 
tions in the proﬁtability of various elements of their product line, in fail- 
ing to attain the maximum possible proﬁt mix within the line. An efﬁ-
cient  producer  or  operator  with  weak  marketing  and  selling  may  be 
compared to a powerful engine that, because of a loose pulley belt or 
badly adjusted differential, is producing only a fraction of the results it 
otherwise would have attained. 

OUTSTANDING RESEARCH AND   
TECHNICAL EFFORT 

Not so very long ago it seemed that outstanding technical ability was  
vital only to a few highly scientiﬁcally oriented industries such as elec- 
tronics, aerospace, pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing. As these 
have grown, their ever-widening technologies have so penetrated virtu- 
ally all lines of manufacturing and nearly all the service industries that 
today to have outstanding research and technical talent is nearly, if not 
quite,  as  important  for  a  shoe  manufacturer,  a  bank,  a  retailer  or  an  
insurance company as it is for what were once considered the exotic sci- 
entiﬁc  industries  that  maintained  large  research  staffs.  Technological 
efforts are now channeled in two directions: to produce new and better 
products (in this connection, research scientists may, of course, do some-
what  more  for  a  chemical  company  than  for  a  grocery  chain)  and  to 
perform services in a better way or at a lower cost than in the past. With 
regard to the latter objective, outstanding technical talent can be equal- 
ly valuable for either group. Actually, in some of the service businesses, 
technological groups are opening up new product lines as well as paving 
the way for performing old services better. Banks are an example. Low-
cost electronic input devices and minicomputers are enabling them to 
offer accounting and bookkeeping services to customers, thus creating  
a new product line for these institutions. 

In research and technology, there is as much variation between the 
efﬁciency of one company and another as there is in marketing. In new 

 
1 8 4  

product development, the complexity of the task almost guarantees this. 
Important as it is, the degree of technical competence or ingenuity of 
one company’s research staff as compared to that of another is only one 
of the factors affecting the beneﬁts that the company derives from its 
research efforts. Developing new products usually calls for the pooling  
of the efforts of a number of researchers, each skilled in a different tech- 
nological specialty. How well these individuals work together (or can be 
induced by a leader to work together and stimulate each other) is often 
as important as the individual competence of the people involved. Fur- 
thermore, to maximize proﬁts, it is vital not to develop just any prod- 
uct but one for which there will be signiﬁcant customer demand, one 
that  (nearly  always)  can  be  sold  by  the  company’s  existing  marketing 
organization,  and  one  that  can  be  made  at  a  price  that  will  yield  a  
worthwhile proﬁt. All of this requires efﬁcient liaison between research 
and both marketing and production. The best corporate research team  
in the world can become nothing but a liability if it develops only prod- 
ucts that cannot be readily sold. For true investment superiority a com-
pany must have above-average ability to control all these complex rela- 
tionships yet at the same time not so overcontrol them as to cause its 
researchers  to  lose  the  drive  and  the  ingenuity  that  made  them  out- 
standing in the ﬁrst place. 

FINANCIAL SKILL 

Again  and  again  in  this  discussion  of  production,  marketing  and  
research,  the  terms  proﬁt  and  proﬁt  margin  have  been  used.  In  a  large  
company with a diverse product line, it is not a simple matter to be sure 
of the cost of each product in relation to the rest, as most costs other 
than materials and direct labor are spread over a number of such prod-
ucts, maybe over all of them. Companies with above-average ﬁnancial 
talent  have  several  signiﬁcant  advantages.  Knowing  accurately  how 
much they make on each product, they can make their greatest efforts 
where these will produce maximum gains. Intimate knowledge of the 
extent of each element of costs, not just in manufacturing but in selling 
and research as well, spotlights in even minor phases of company activ-
ity the places where it is logical to make special efforts to reduce costs, 
either through technological innovations or by improving people’s spe-
ciﬁc assignments. Most important of all, through skillful budgeting and 

The First Dimension of a Conservative Investment   

1 8 5 

accounting, the truly outstanding company can create an early-warning 
system whereby unfavorable inﬂuences that threaten the proﬁt plan can 
be  quickly  detected.  Remedial  action  can  then  be  taken  to  avoid  the 
painful surprises that have jolted investors in many companies. Nor do 
the “goodies” that accrue to investors from superior ﬁnancial skills stop 
at this point. They usually lead to a better choice of capital investments 
that bring the highest return on the company’s investment capital. They 
also can lead to better control of receivables and inventory, a matter of 
increasing importance in periods of high interest rates. 

To summarize:The company that qualiﬁes well in this ﬁrst dimen-
sion of a conservative investment is a very low-cost producer or opera-
tor  in  its  ﬁeld,  has  outstanding  marketing  and  ﬁnancial  ability  and  a 
demonstrated above-average skill on the complex managerial problem  
of attaining worthwhile results from its research or technological organ- 
ization. In a world where change is occurring at an ever-increasing pace, 
it is (1) a company capable of developing a ﬂow of new and proﬁtable 
products or product lines that will more than balance older lines that 
may become obsolete by the technological innovations of others; (2) a 
company able now and in the future to make these lines at costs sufﬁ-
ciently low so as to generate a proﬁt stream that will grow at least as fast  
as  sales  and  that  even  in  the  worst  years  of  general  business  will  not 
diminish  to  a  point  that  threatens  the  safety  of  an  investment  in  the  
business;  and  (3)  a  company  able  to  sell  its  newer  products  and  those 
which it may develop in the future at least as proﬁtably as those with 
which it is involved today. 

This  is  a  one-dimensional  picture  of  a  prudent  investment—one 
which, if not spoiled by the view from other dimensions, represents an  
investment with which the investor is unlikely to become disillusioned. 
But before going on to examine these other dimensions, there is one 
additional point that should be fully understood. If the objective is con- 
serving one’s funds, if the goal is safety, why have we been talking about 
growth and the development of new and additional product lines? Why 
isn’t it enough to maintain a business at its existing size and level of prof- 
its  without  running  all  the  risks  that  occur  when  new  endeavors  are 
started? When we come to a discussion of the inﬂuence of inﬂation on 
investments,  other  reasons  for  the  importance  of  growth  will  present 
themselves.  But  fundamentally  it  should  never  be  forgotten  that,  in  a 
world where change is occurring at a faster and faster pace, nothing long 
remains the same. It is impossible to stand still. A company will either 

 
1 8 6  

grow or shrink. A strong offense is the best defense. Only by growing 
better  can  a  company  be  sure  of  not  growing  worse.  Companies  that 
have failed to go uphill have invariably gone downhill—and, if that has 
been  true  in  the  past,  it  will  be  even  more  true  in  the  future. This  is 
because, in addition to an ever-increasing pace of technological innova- 
tion, changing social customs and buying habits and new demands of 
government  are  altering  at  an  ever-increasing  pace  the  rate  at  which 
even the stodgiest industries are changing. 

2

The Second Dimension

The People Factor

Brieﬂy summarized, the ﬁrst dimension of a conservative investment 

consists of outstanding managerial competence in the basic areas of 
production,  marketing,  research,  and  ﬁnancial  controls. This  ﬁrst 
dimension describes a business as it is today, being essentially a matter of 
results. The  second  dimension  deals  with  what  produced  these  results 
and, more importantly, will continue to produce them in the future. The 
force that causes such things to happen, that creates one company in an 
industry  that  is  an  outstanding  investment  vehicle  and  another  that  is 
average, mediocre, or worse, is essentially people. 

Edward  H.  Heller,  a  pioneer  venture  capitalist  whose  comments 
during his business life greatly inﬂuenced some of the ideas expressed  
in this book, used the term “vivid spirit” to describe the type of indi- 
vidual to whom he was ready to give signiﬁcant ﬁnancial backing. He 
said  that  behind  every  unusually  successful  corporation  was  this  kind 
of  determined  entrepreneurial  personality  with  the  drive,  the  origi- 
nal  ideas,  and  the  skill  to  make  such  a  company  a  truly  worthwhile 
investment. 

Within the area of very small companies that grew into consider- 
ably larger and quite prosperous ones (the ﬁeld of his greatest interest  
and  where  he  scored  his  most  spectacular  successes),  Ed  Heller  was 
undoubtedly right. But as these smaller companies grow larger on the 

1 8 7

1 8 8  

way to becoming suitable for conservative investment, Ed Heller’s view 
might  be  tempered  by  that  of  another  brilliant  businessman  who 
expressed serious doubts about the wisdom of investing in a company 
whose president was his close personal friend. This man’s reason for lack 
of  enthusiasm: “My  friend  is  one  of  the  most  brilliant  men  I’ve  ever 
known. He always has to be right. In a small company this may be ﬁne. 
But as you grow, your men have to be right sometimes, too.” 

Here is an indication of the heart of the second dimension of a truly 
conservative investment: a corporate chief executive dedicated to long-
range growth who has surrounded himself with and delegated consider- 
able authority to an extremely competent team in charge of the various 
divisions and functions of the company. These people must be engaged 
not in an endless internal struggle for power but instead should be work-
ing together toward clearly outlined corporate goals. One of these goals, 
which is absolutely essential if an investment is to be a truly successful 
one, is that top management take the time to identify and train qualiﬁed 
and  motivated  juniors  to  succeed  senior  management  whenever  a 
replacement is necessary. In turn, at each level down through the chain 
of command, detailed attention should be paid to whether those at this 
level are doing the same thing for those one level below them. 

Does this mean that a company that qualiﬁes for truly conservative 
investing  should  promote  only  from  within  and  should  never  recruit 
from  the  outside  except  at  the  lowest  levels  or  for  those  just  starting  
their careers? A company growing at a very rapid rate may have such 
need for additional people that there just isn’t time to train from with- 
in  for  all  positions.  Furthermore,  even  the  best-run  company  will  at 
times need an individual with a highly specialized skill so far removed  
from the general activities of the company that such a specialty simply 
cannot be found internally. Someone with expertise in a particular sub- 
division  of  the  law,  insurance,  or  a  scientiﬁc  discipline  well  removed  
from the company’s main line of activity would be a case in point. In 
addition, occasional hiring from the outside has one advantage: It can 
bring  a  new  viewpoint  into  corporate  councils,  an  injection  of  fresh 
ideas to challenge the accepted way as the best way. 

In general, however, the company with real investment merit is the 
company that usually promotes from within. This is because all compa- 
nies of the highest investment order (these do not necessarily have to be 
the biggest and best-known companies) have developed a set of policies 
and ways of doing things peculiar to their own needs. If these special 

The Second Dimension 

1 8 9 

ways are truly worthwhile, it is always difﬁcult and frequently impossi- 
ble to retrain those long accustomed to them to different ways of get-
ting things done. The higher up in an organization the newcomer may 
be, the more costly the indoctrination can be. While I can quote no sta- 
tistics to prove the point, it is my observation that in better-run com-
panies  a  surprising  number  of  executives  brought  in  close  to  the  top 
tend to disappear after a few years. 

Of one thing the investor can be certain:A large company’s need to 
bring in a new chief executive from the outside is a damning sign of 
something basically wrong with the existing management—no matter 
how  good  the  surface  signs  may  have  been  as  indicated  by  the  most 
recent earnings statement. It may well be that the new president will do 
a magniﬁcent job and in time will build a genuine management team 
around him so that such a jolt to the existing organization will never  
again  become  necessary.  Consequently,  in  time  such  a  stock  may  
become one worthy of a wise investor. But such rebuilding can be so  
long and risky a process that, if an investor ﬁnds this sort of thing hap- 
pening in one of his holdings, he will do well to review all his invest-
ment activities to determine whether his past actions have really been 
proceeding from a sound base. 

A worthwhile clue is available to all investors as to whether a man- 
agement is predominantly one man or a smoothly working team (this 
clue throws no light, however, on how good that team may be). The annu- 
al salaries of top management of all publicly owned companies are made 
public in the proxy statements. If the salary of the number-one man is 
very much larger than that of the next two or three, a warning ﬂag is ﬂy- 
ing. If the compensation scale goes down rather gradually, it isn’t. 

For optimum results for the investor it is not enough that manage- 
ment personnel work together as a team and be capable of ﬁlling vacan-
cies above them. There should also be present the greatest possible num-
ber of those “vivid spirits” of Ed Heller’s—people with the ingenuity 
and determination not to leave things just at their present, possibly quite 
satisfactory,  state  but  to  build  signiﬁcant  further  improvements  upon 
them.  Such  people  are  not  easy  to  ﬁnd.  Motorola,  Inc.,  has  for  some  
time been conducting an activity that the ﬁnancial community has paid 
little or no attention to that indicates it is possible to accomplish dra- 
matically more in this area than is generally considered possible. 

In  1967  Motorola  management  recognized  that  the  rapid  rate  of 
growth anticipated in the years ahead would inevitably require steady 

 
1 9 0  

expansion in the upper layers of management. It was decided to meet  
the problem head on. In that year Motorola opened its Executive Insti- 
tute at Oracle,  Arizona. It was designed so that, in an atmosphere remote 
from  the  daily  details  of  the  company’s  ofﬁces  and  plants,  two  things 
would happen: Motorola personnel of apparent unusual promise would 
be trained in matters beyond the scope of their immediate activities in  
order  to  be  able  to  take  on  more  important  jobs;  top  management  
would be furnished signiﬁcant further evidence as to the degree of pro- 
motability of these same people. 

At the time of the Executive Institute’s founding, skeptics within the 
management questioned whether the effort would be worth the cost. 
This was largely because of their belief that fewer than a hundred peo-
ple would be found in the whole Motorola organization with sufﬁcient 
talent  to  make  it  worthwhile  from  the  company’s  standpoint  to  pro-
vide them with this special training. Events have proven these skeptics 
spectacularly wrong. The Institute handles ﬁve to six classes a year, with 
fourteen  in  each  class.  By  mid-1974  about  400  Motorola  people  had 
gone through the school; and a signiﬁcant number, including some pres-
ent vice-presidents, were found to have capabilities vastly greater than 
anything contemplated at the time they were approved for admission. 
Furthermore, those involved in this work feel that, from the company’s 
standpoint, results in the more recent classes are even more favorable than 
in the earlier ones. It now appears that, as total employment at Motorola 
continues  to  expand  with  the  company’s  growth,  enough  promising 
Motorola people can be found to maintain this activity indeﬁnitely. All 
of this shows, from the investor’s standpoint, that if enough ingenuity is 
used, even the companies with well-above-average growth rates can also 
“grow” the needed unusual people from within so as to maintain com- 
petitive superiority without running the high risk of friction and failure 
that so often occurs when a rapidly growing company must go to the 
outside for more than a very small part of its outstanding talent. 

Everyone has a personality—a combination of character traits that 
sets him or her apart from every other individual. Similarly, every cor- 
poration has its own ways of doing things—some formalized into well- 
articulated policies, others not—that are at least slightly different from 
those  of  other  corporations. The  more  successful  the  corporation,  the 
more likely it is to be unique in some of its policies. This is particularly 
true of companies that have been successful for a considerable period of  
time.  In  contrast  to  individuals,  whose  fundamental  character  traits 

The Second Dimension 

1 9 1 

change but little once they reach maturity, the ways of companies are 
inﬂuenced  not  only  by  outside  events  but  by  the  reactions  to  those 
events of a whole series of different personalities who, as time goes on, 
follow one another in the top posts within the organization. 

However  much  policies  may  differ  among  companies,  there  are 
three elements that must always be present if a company’s shares are to 
be worthy of holding for conservative, long-range investment. 

1.  The company must recognize that the world in which  
it is operating is changing at an ever-increasing rate. 

All corporate thinking and planning must be attuned to challenge what 
is  now  being  done—to  challenge  it  not  occasionally  but  again  and  
again. Every accepted way of doing things must be examined and re- 
examined to be as sure as is permitted by human fallibility that this way 
is really the best way. Some risks must be accepted in substituting new 
methods to meet changing conditions. No matter how comfortable it 
may  seem  to  do  so,  ways  of  doing  things  cannot  be  maintained  just 
because they worked well in the past and are hallowed by tradition. The 
company  that  is  rigid  in  its  actions  and  is  not  constantly  challenging 
itself has only one way to go, and that way is down. In contrast, certain 
managements of large companies that have deliberately endeavored to 
structure  themselves  so  as  to  be  able  to  change  have  been  those  pro- 
ducing  some  of  the  most  striking  rewards  for  their  shareholders. An 
example  of  this  is  the  Dow  Chemical  Company,  with  a  record  of 
achievements over the last ten years that is frequently considered to sur-
pass that of any other major chemical company in this country, if not in 
the  entire  world.  Possibly  Dow’s  most  signiﬁcant  departure  from  past 
ways was to break its management into ﬁve separate managements on 
geographical lines (Dow USA, Dow Europe, Dow Canada, etc.). It was 
believed that only in this way could local problems be handled quickly  
as best suited local conditions and without suffering from the bureau-
cratic inefﬁciencies that so often accompany bigness. The net effect of 
this  as  told  by  the  president  of  Dow  Europe: “The  results  that  today 
challenge us are being made by our sister [Dow] companies throughout 
the world. They, not our direct competitors, are turning in the gains that 
push  us  to  be  ﬁrst.”  From  the  investor’s  standpoint  perhaps  the  most 
important feature of this change was not that it was made but that it was 
made when Dow still had a total sales volume much smaller than many 

 
1 9 2  

other  multinational  companies  that  were  operating  successfully  in  the 
established  way.  In  other  words,  change  and  improvement  arose  from 
innovative  thinking  to  make  a  workable  system  better—not  from  a 
forced reaction to a crisis. 

This is but one of the many ways this pioneering company has bro- 
ken with the past to attain its striking competitive record. Another was 
the  unprecedented  step  for  an  industrial  company  of  starting  from  
scratch to make a success of a wholly owned bank in Switzerland so as  
to help ﬁnance the needs of its customers in the export market. Here 
again the management did not hesitate to break with the past in ways 
that  engendered  some  risk  in  the  early  stages  but  that  ended  up  by 
enhancing the intrinsic strength of the company. 

Many other examples could be cited from the record of this compa- 
ny.  However,  just  one  more  will  be  mentioned  merely  to  show  the 
extreme variety of areas such actions may cover. Far earlier than most 
other companies, Dow not only recognized the need to spend sizable 
sums to avoid pollution but concluded that, if major results were to be 
attained, something more was needed than just exhortations from top 
management. It was necessary to obtain the consistent cooperation of 
middle-level managers. It was decided that the surest way of doing this 
was to appeal to the proﬁt motives of those most directly involved. They 
were encouraged to ﬁnd proﬁtable methods of converting the polluting  
materials to salable products. The rest is now business history. With the full 
power of top management, plant management, and highly skilled chemi-
cal engineers behind these projects, Dow has achieved a series of ﬁrsts in 
eliminating pollution that has won them the praise of many environmen- 
tal groups that are usually quite antibusiness in their viewpoints. Possibly 
more important, they have avoided hostility in most, although not all, of 
the communities where their plants are located. They have done this at 
very little over-all dollar cost and in some cases at an operating proﬁt. 

2.  There must always be a conscious and continuous  
effort, based on fact, not propaganda, to have employees  
at every level, from the most newly hired blue-collar or  
white-collar worker to the highest levels of management,  
feel that their company is a good place to work. 

This is a world that requires most of us to put in a substantial number  
of  hours  each  week  doing  what  is  asked  of  us  by  others  in  order  to  

The Second Dimension 

1 9 3 

receive a paycheck even though we might prefer to spend those hours  
on our own amusement or recreation. Most people recognize the neces- 
sity for this. When a management can instill a belief, not just among a  
few  top  people  but  generally  among  the  employees,  that  it  is  doing 
everything reasonably to be expected to create a good working envi- 
ronment and take care of its employees’ interests, the rewards the com-
pany  receives  in  greater  productivity  and  lower  costs  can  vastly  out-
weigh the costs of such a policy. 

The ﬁrst step in this policy is seeing (not just talking about it but 
actually assuring) that every employee is treated with reasonable digni- 
ty and consideration. A year or so ago I read in the press that a union 
ofﬁcial  claimed  that  one  of  the  nation’s  largest  companies  was  com-
pelling its production-line employees to eat lunch with grease-stained 
hands because there was not sufﬁcient time, with the number of wash-
room  facilities  available,  for  most  of  them  to  be  able  to  wash  before 
lunch. The stock of this company was of no investment interest to me  
for quite different reasons. Therefore, I have no knowledge of whether 
the charge was based on fact or was made in the heat of an emotional 
battle  over  wage  negotiations.  However,  if  true,  this  condition  alone 
would, in my opinion, make the shares of this company unsuitable for 
holding by careful investors. 

Besides treating employees with dignity and decency, the routes to 
obtaining genuine employee loyalty are many and varied. Pension and 
proﬁt-sharing plans can play a signiﬁcant part. So can good communi- 
cation to and from all levels of employees. Concerning matters of gen-
eral interest, letting everyone know not only exactly what is being done 
but  why  frequently  eliminates  friction  that  might  otherwise  occur.  
Actually  knowing  what  people  in  various  levels  of  the  company  are 
thinking,  particularly  when  that  view  is  adverse,  can  be  even  more 
important. A feeling throughout the company that people can express 
their grievances to superiors without fear of reprisal can be beneﬁcial, 
although this open-door policy is not always simple to maintain because 
of the time wasted by cranks and nuts. When grievances occur, decisions 
on what to do about them should be made quickly. It is the long-smol-
dering grievance that usually proves the most costly. 

A striking example of the beneﬁts that may be attained through cre- 
ating  a  unity  of  purpose  with  employees  is  the “people-effectiveness” 
program of Texas Instruments. The history of this program is an excel-
lent example of how brilliant management perseveres with and perfects 

 
1 9 4  

policies of this sort even when new outside inﬂuences force some redi- 
rection of these policies. From the early days of this company, top man- 
agement held a deep conviction that everyone would gain if a system 
could be set up whereby all employees participated in managerial-type 
decisions  to  improve  performance  but  that,  to  sustain  interest  on  the  
part  of  employees,  all  participants  must  genuinely  beneﬁt  from  the 
results  of  their  contributions.  In  the  1950s  semiconductor  production  
was largely a matter of hand assembly, offering many opportunities for 
employees to make brilliant individual suggestions for improving per- 
formance. Meetings, even formal classes, were held in which production 
workers were shown how they could as individuals or groups show the 
way  to  improving  operations. At  the  same  time,  through  both  proﬁt- 
sharing plans and awards and honors, those participating beneﬁted both 
ﬁnancially and by feeling they were part of the picture. Then mecha- 
nization  of  these  former  manual  operations  started  to  appear. As  this 
trend  grew,  there  was  somewhat  less  opportunity  for  certain  types  of 
individual  contributions,  as  in  certain  ways  the  machines  controlled 
what  would  be  done. A  few  foremen  within  the  organization  began 
feeling that there was no longer a place for lower-level contributions to 
management-type participation. Top management took quite the oppo-
site viewpoint: People-participation would play a greater role than ever  
before.  Now,  however,  it  would  be  a  group  or  team  effort  with  the 
workers as a group estimating what could be done and setting their own 
goals for performance. 

Because workers started feeling that they (1) were genuinely partic- 
ipating in decisions, not just being told what to do, and (2) were being 
rewarded  both  ﬁnancially  and  in  honors  and  recognition,  the  results  
have been spectacular. In instance after instance, teams of workers have  
set for themselves goals quite considerably higher than anything man- 
agement would have considered suggesting. At times when it appeared 
that targeted goals might not be met or when inter-team competition 
was producing rivalry, the workers proposed and voluntarily voted such 
unheard-of  things  (for  this  day  and  age)  as  cutting  down  on  coffee  
breaks or shortening lunch periods to get the work out. The pressure of 
peer  groups  on  the  tardy  or  lazy  worker  who  threatens  the  goals  the 
group has set for itself dwarfs any amount of discipline that might be 
exerted  from  above  through  conventional  management  methods.  Nor 
are  these  results  conﬁned  to  U.S.  workers  with  their  lifelong  back- 
ground in political democracy. They appear to be equally effective and 

The Second Dimension 

1 9 5 

mutually beneﬁcial to people, regardless of the color of their skin and 
their origins from countries of quite different economic backgrounds. 
Though  the  performance-goal  plan  was  ﬁrst  initiated  in  the  United 
States,  equally  striking  results  have  appeared  not  just  in Texas  Instru- 
ments plants in the so-called developed industrial nations such as France 
and Japan but also in Singapore, with its native Asian employees, and in 
Curaçao,  where  those  on  the  payroll  are  overwhelmingly  black.  In  all  
countries  the  morale  effects  appear  striking  when  worker  teams  not  
only  report  directly  to  top  management  levels  but  also  know  their  
reports  will  be  heeded  and  their  accomplishments  recognized  and 
acknowledged. 

What all this has meant to investors was spelled out when compa- 
ny  president  Mark  Shepherd,  Jr.,  addressed  stockholders  at  the  1974 
annual  meeting.  He  stated  that  a  people-effectiveness  index  had  been 
established consisting of the net sales billed divided by the total payroll. 
Since semiconductors, the company’s largest product line, are one of the 
very few products in today’s inﬂationary world that consistently decline 
in unit price and since wages have been rising at the company’s plants 
at rates from 7 percent a year in the United States to 20 percent in Italy 
and  Japan,  it  would  be  logical  to  expect,  in  spite  of  improvements  in 
people-effectiveness,  this  index  to  decline.  Instead  it  rose  from  about  
2.25 percent in 1969 to 2.5 percent by the end of 1973. Furthermore,  
with  deﬁnite  plans  for  additional  improvement  and  with  further  
increases  in  proﬁt-sharing  funds  tied  into  such  improvement,  it  was 
announced  that  it  was  the  company’s  goal  to  bring  the  index  up  to  
3.1 percent by 1980—a goal that, if attained, would make the company  
a dramatically proﬁtable place to work. Over the years Texas Instruments 
has frequently publicized some rather ambitious long-range goals and to 
date has rather consistently accomplished them. 

From the investment standpoint, there are some extremely impor-
tant similarities in the three examples of people-oriented programs that 
were chosen to illustrate aspects of the second dimension of a conser- 
vative investment. It is a relatively simple matter to mention and give a  
general  description  of  Motorola’s  institute  for  selecting  and  training 
unusual  talent  to  handle  the  growing  needs  of  the  company.  It  is  an  
equally simple affair to mention that Dow found a means to stimulate 
people to work together to master environmental problems and to make 
them proﬁtable for the company, or to state a few facts about the remark-
able  people-effectiveness  program  at  Texas  Instruments.  However,  if  

 
1 9 6  

another company decided to start programs like these from scratch, the 
problems  that  could  arise  might  be  inﬁnitely  more  complicated  than 
merely persuading a board of directors to approve the necessary appro- 
priation. Programs of this kind are easy to formulate, but their imple- 
mentation is a quite different matter. Mistakes can be very costly. It is  
not  hard  to  imagine  what  might  happen  if  a  training  school  such  as 
Motorola’s  selected  the  wrong  people  for  promotion,  with  the  result  
that the best junior talent quit the company in disgust. Similarly, suppose 
a  company  tried  to  follow,  in  general,  a  people-effectiveness  plan  but  
either  failed  to  create  an  atmosphere  where  workers  genuinely  felt 
themselves involved or failed to compensate their employees adequate- 
ly, with the result that they became disillusioned. The misapplication of 
such a program could literally wreck a company. Meanwhile, companies 
that  do  perfect  advantageous  people-oriented  policies  and  techniques 
usually ﬁnd more and more ways to beneﬁt from them. For these com-
panies, such policies and techniques—these special ways of approaching 
problems and of solving them—are in a sense proprietary. For this reason 
they are of great importance to long-range investors. 

3.   Management must be willing to submit itself to the 
disciplines required for sound growth. 

It has already been pointed out that in this rapidly changing world com-
panies cannot stand still. They must either get better or worse, improve  
or go downhill. The true investment objective of growth is not just to  
make gains but to avoid loss. There are very few companies whose man- 
agements will not make claims to being growth companies. However, a 
management that talks about being growth-oriented is not necessarily 
actually so oriented. Many companies seem to have an irresistible urge to 
show the greatest possible proﬁts at the end of each accounting period— 
to  bring  every  possible  cent  down  to  the  bottom  line. This  a  true 
growth-oriented company can never do. Its focus must be on earning 
sufﬁcient current proﬁts to ﬁnance the costs of expanding the business. 
When adjustment for earning the required additional ﬁnancial strength 
has been made, the company worthy of farsighted investment will give 
priority to curtailing maximum immediate proﬁts when there are gen-
uine worthwhile opportunities for developing new products or process- 
es or for starting new product lines or for any one of the hundred and 
one  more  mundane  actions  whereby  a  dollar  spent  today  may  mean 

The Second Dimension 

1 9 7 

many  dollars  earned  in  the  future.  Such  actions  can  vary  all  the  way  
from hiring and training new personnel that will be needed as the busi-
ness grows to forgoing the greatest possible proﬁt on a customer’s order 
to build up his permanent loyalty by rushing something to him when  
he  needs  it  badly.  For  the  conservative  investor,  the  test  of  all  such  
actions  is  whether  management  is  truly  building  up  the  long-range 
proﬁts of the business rather than just seeming to. No matter how well 
known, the company with a policy that only gives lip service to these 
disciplines is not likely to prove a happy vehicle for investment funds. 
Neither  is  one  that  tries  to  follow  these  disciplines  but  falls  down  in 
executing  them,  as,  for  example,  a  company  that  makes  large  research 
expenditures but so mishandles its efforts as to gain little from them.

The Third Dimension

Investment Characteristics  
of Some Businesses

The ﬁrst dimension of a conservative stock investment is the degree 

of excellence in the company’s activities that are most important to 
present and future proﬁtability. The second dimension is the quali- 
ty of the people controlling these activities and the policies they create. 
The third dimension deals with something quite different: the degree to 
which there does or does not exist within the nature of the business itself 
certain  inherent  characteristics  that  make  possible  an  above-average 
proﬁtability for as long as can be foreseen into the future. 

Before examining these characteristics it may be well to point out 
why above-average proﬁtability is so important to the investor, not only 
as a source of further gain but as a protection for what he already has. 
The vital role of growth in this connection has already been discussed. 
Growth costs money in many ways. Part of what otherwise would be  
the proﬁt stream has to be diverted to experimenting, inventing, test- 
marketing, new-product marketing, and all the other operating costs of 
expansion, including the complete loss of the inevitable percentage of 
such expansion attempts that are bound to fail. Even more costly may 
be the additions to factories or stores or equipment that must be made. 
Meanwhile,  as  the  business  grows,  more  inventory  will  inevitably  be 

1 9 8

The Third Dimension 

1 9 9 

needed to ﬁll the pipelines. Finally, except for the very few businesses 
that sell only for cash, there will be a corresponding drain on corporate 
resources to take care of the growing volume of receivables. To accom-
plish all these things, proﬁtability is vital. 

In  inﬂationary  periods  the  matter  of  proﬁtability  becomes  even  
more important. Usually when prices and, therefore, costs are rising on  
a  broad  front,  a  business  can,  in  time,  pass  these  costs  along  through 
higher prices of its own. However, this often cannot be done immedi- 
ately. During the interim, obviously a much smaller bite is taken out of 
the proﬁts of the broad-proﬁt-margin company than occurs for its high-
er-cost competition, since the higher-cost company is probably facing 
comparably increased costs of doing business. 

Proﬁtability  can  be  expressed  in  two  ways. The  fundamental  way, 
which  is  the  yardstick  used  by  most  managements,  is  the  return  on 
invested  assets. This  is  the  factor  that  will  cause  a  company  to  decide 
whether  to  go  ahead  with  a  new  product  or  process. What  percent  
return can the company expect on the part of its capital invested in this 
particular way in comparison to what the return might be if the same 
amount of its assets was employed in some other way? It is considerably 
more difﬁcult for the investor to use this yardstick than it is for the cor- 
porate executive. What the investor usually sees is not the return on a 
speciﬁc amount of present-day dollars utilized in a speciﬁc subdivision 
of the business but the total earnings of the business as a percentage of  
its total assets. When the cost of capital equipment has risen as much as 
it has in the last forty years, comparisons of the return on total invested 
capital between one company and another may be so distorted by vari-
ations  in  the  price  levels  at  which  different  companies  made  major 
expenditures  that  the  ﬁgures  are  highly  misleading.  For  this  reason, 
comparing the proﬁt margins per dollar of sales may be more helpful as 
long as one other point is kept in mind. This is that a company that has  
a high rate of sales in relation to assets may be a more proﬁtable com-
pany than one with a higher proﬁt margin to sales but a slower rate of 
sales turnover. For example, a company that has annual sales three times 
its  assets  can  have  a  lower  proﬁt  margin  but  make  a  lot  more  money  
than one that needs to employ a dollar of assets in order to obtain each 
dollar of annual sales. However, while from the standpoint of proﬁtability 
return  on  investment  must  be  considered  as  well  as  proﬁt  margin  on 
sales,  from  the  standpoint  of  safety  of  investment  all  the  emphasis  is  on 
proﬁt margin on sales. Thus if two companies were each to experience 

 
2 0 0  

a 2 percent increase in operating costs and were unable to raise prices, 
the one with a 1 percent margin of proﬁt would be running at a loss 
and might be wiped out, while, if the other had a 10 percent margin,  
the increased costs would wipe out only one-ﬁfth of its proﬁts. 

There is one ﬁnal matter to be kept in mind in order to place this 
dimension  of  conservative  investing  in  proper  perspective:  In  today’s 
highly ﬂuid and competitive business world, obtaining well-above-aver-
age proﬁt margins or a high return on assets is so desirable that, when-
ever a company accomplishes this goal for any signiﬁcant period of time, 
it is bound to be faced with a host of potential competitors. If the poten-
tial competitors actually enter the ﬁeld, they will cut into markets the 
established  company  now  has.  Normally,  when  potential  competition 
becomes actual competition the ensuing struggle for sales results in any-
thing from a minor to a major reduction in the high proﬁt margin that  
had  theretofore  existed.  High  proﬁt  margins  may  be  compared  to  an 
open jar of honey owned by the prospering company. The honey will 
inevitably attract a swarm of hungry insects bent on devouring it. In the 
business world there are but two ways a company can protect the con-
tents of its honey jar from being consumed by the insects of competi- 
tion.  One  is  by  monopoly,  which  is  usually  illegal,  although,  if  the 
monopoly  is  due  to  patent  protection,  it  may  not  be.  In  any  event, 
monopolies are likely to end quite suddenly and do not commend them-
selves as vehicles for the safest type of investing. The other way for the 
honey-jar company to keep the insects out is to operate so much more 
efﬁciently than others that there is no incentive for present or potential 
competition to take action that will upset the existing situation. 

Now let us turn from this background discussion of relative prof- 
itability to the heart of the third dimension of conservative investing— 
namely,  the  speciﬁc  characteristics  that  enable  certain  well-managed 
companies to maintain above-average proﬁt margins more or less indef-
initely. Possibly the most common characteristic is what businessmen call 
the “economies of scale.” A simple example of economy of scale: A well- 
run company making one million units a month will often have a lower 
production cost for each unit than a company producing only 100,000 
units in the same period. The difference between the cost per unit of 
these two companies, one ten times larger than the other, can vary con- 
siderably  from  one  line  of  business  to  another.  In  some  there  may  be 
almost no difference at all. Furthermore, it should never be forgotten that 
in any industry the larger company will have a maximum advantage only 

The Third Dimension 

2 0 1 

if it is exceedingly well run. The bigger a company is, the harder it is to 
manage efﬁciently. Quite often the inherent advantages of scale are fully 
balanced or even more than balanced by the inefﬁciencies produced by 
too many bureaucratic layers of middle management, consequent delays 
in making decisions, and, at times, the seeming inability of top executives 
in  the  largest  companies  to  know  quickly  just  what  needs  corrective 
attention in various subdivisions of their far-ﬂung complexes. 

On the other hand, when a company clearly becomes the leader in 
its ﬁeld, not just in dollar volume but in proﬁtability, it seldom gets dis- 
placed  from  this  position  as  long  as  its  management  remains  highly 
competent. As discussed in examining the second dimension of a con- 
servative  investment,  such  a  management  must  retain  the  ability  to  
change  corporate  ways  to  match  the  ever-changing  external  environ- 
ment. There is a school of investment thinking that advocates acquiring 
shares in the number-two or -three company in a ﬁeld because “these 
can go up to number one, whereas the leader is already there and might 
slip.” There  are  some  industries  where  the  largest  company  does  not 
have a clear leadership position; but, where it does, we emphatically do  
not  agree  with  this  viewpoint.  It  has  been  our  observation  that,  in  
many years of trying, Westinghouse has not surpassed General Electric, 
Montgomery Ward  has  not  overtaken  Sears,  and—once  IBM  estab- 
lished early dominance in its areas of the computer market—even the  
extreme  efforts  of  some  of  the  largest  companies  in  the  country,  
including General Electric, did not succeed in displacing IBM from its  
overwhelming  share  of  that  market.  Neither  have  scores  of  smaller 
price-cutting  suppliers  of  peripheral  equipment  been  able  to  displace 
IBM  as  the  main  and  most  proﬁtable  operator  in  that  phase  of  the 
computer industry. 

What enables a company to obtain this advantage of scale in the ﬁrst 
place?  Usually  getting  there  ﬁrst  with  a  new  product  or  service  that 
meets worthwhile demand and backing this up with good enough mar- 
keting,  servicing,  product  improvement,  and,  at  times,  advertising  to 
keep  existing  customers  happy  and  coming  back  for  more. This  fre-
quently establishes an atmosphere in which new customers will turn to 
the leader largely because that leader has established such a reputation 
for performance (or sound value) that no one is likely to criticize the 
buyer adversely for making this particular selection. In the heyday of the 
attempts of others to cut into IBM’s computer business, no one will ever 
know how many employees of corporations planning to use a computer 

 
2 0 2  

for the ﬁrst time recommended IBM rather than a smaller competitor 
whose equipment they privately thought was better or cheaper. In such 
instances the primary motive was probably a feeling that if, later on, the 
equipment should fail to perform, those making the recommendation 
would not be blamed if they had chosen the industry leader but could 
very well ﬁnd their necks out a mile if a failure occurred and they had 
chosen a smaller company without an established reputation. 

There is a saying in the pharmaceutical industry that, when a truly 
worthwhile new drug is created, the company that gets in ﬁrst takes and 
holds 60 percent of the market, thereby making by far the bulk of the 
proﬁts. The  next  company  to  introduce  a  competitive  version  of  the 
same product gets perhaps 25 percent of the market and makes moder- 
ate proﬁts. The next three companies to arrive divide perhaps 10 per-
cent to 15 percent of the market and earn meager proﬁts. Any further 
entrants  usually  ﬁnd  themselves  in  a  quite  unhappy  position. A  trend 
toward the substitution of generic for trade names may or may not upset 
these ratios, and in any case there cannot be said to be an exact formu- 
la applicable to other industries; nevertheless, the concept behind them 
should be kept in mind when an investor attempts  to appraise  which 
companies have a natural advantage in regard to proﬁtability and which 
do not. 

Lower production costs and greater ability to attract new customers 
because of a well-recognized trade name are not the only ways that scale 
can consistently give a company competitive strength. Examining some 
of the factors behind the investment strength of the soup division of the 
Campbell Soup Company is illuminating. In the ﬁrst place, as by far the 
largest soup canners in the nation, this company can reduce total costs 
through  backward  integration  as  smaller  companies  cannot.  Making 
many  of  their  own  cans  exactly  to  meet  their  own  needs  is  a  case  in 
point.  More  important,  Campbell  has  enough  business  so  that  it  can 
scatter canning plants at strategic spots across the nation, which makes 
for a sizable double advantage: It is both a shorter haul for the grower 
delivering his produce to the cannery and a shorter average haul from 
cannery to supermarket. Since canned soup is heavy  in  relation  to  its 
value, freight costs are signiﬁcant. This puts the smaller canner with only 
one  or  two  plants  at  a  big  disadvantage  in  trying  to  compete  in  a  
nationwide market. Next, and probably most important of all, because 
Campbell’s is a recognized product that the customer knows and wants 
when he enters the supermarket, the retailer automatically awards to it  

The Third Dimension 

2 0 3 

a prominent and fairly sizable area of his always sought-after shelf space. 
In contrast, he is usually quite reluctant to do as much for a less-known 
or  unknown  competitor. This  prominent  shelf  space  helps  to  sell  the  
soup and is still another factor tending to keep the number-one com-
pany on top, a factor extremely discouraging for potential competitors. 
Also  discouraging  for  them  is  Campbell’s  normal  advertising  budget, 
which adds very much less to the cost per can sold than such a budget 
would for a competitor with a very much smaller output. For reasons 
such as these, this particular company has strong inherent forces tending 
to protect proﬁt margins. However, to present a complete picture, we 
must  note  some  inﬂuences  working  in  the  opposite  direction. When 
Campbell’s own costs rise, as they can do sharply in an inﬂationary peri- 
od, prices to the consumer cannot be raised more than the average of 
other  foods  or  there  could  be  a  shift  in  demand  away  from  soups  to  
other staples. Far more important, Campbell has a major competitor that 
most companies do not have to contend with and that, as rising pro- 
duction costs cause higher prices to the consumer, can cut signiﬁcantly 
into  Campbell’s  market. This  is  the American  housewife  ﬁghting  her 
battle of the budget by making soup in her own kitchen. This point is 
mentioned merely to show that even when scale affords huge compet- 
itive advantages and a company is well run, these characteristics, impor-
tant as they are, do not, of themselves, assure extreme proﬁtability. 

Scale is by no means the only investment factor tending to perpet- 
uate the much greater proﬁtability and investment appeal of some com-
panies over others. Another which we believe is of particular interest is 
the difﬁculty of competing with a highly successful, established produc- 
er in a technological area where the technology depends on not one sci- 
entiﬁc discipline but the interplay of two or preferably several quite dif- 
ferent disciplines. To explain what I mean, let us suppose that someone 
develops  an  electronic  product  that  promises  to  open  up  sizable  new 
markets in either the computer or instrument ﬁeld. There are enough 
highly capable companies in both areas that have in-house experts able  
to  duplicate  both  the  electronic  hardware  and  the  software  program- 
ming that such products require so that if the new market appears large 
enough, sufﬁcient competition may soon develop to make the proﬁts of 
the smaller innovator rather tenuous. In areas such as these, the success- 
ful large company has a further built-in advantage. Many such lines can-
not be sold unless a network of service people is available to make rapid 
repair at the customers’ locations. The large established company usually 

 
2 0 4  

has such an organization in being. It is extremely difﬁcult and expensive 
for  a  small  new  company  introducing  a  worthwhile  new  product  to 
establish such a network. It may be even harder for the new company 
to convince a potential buyer that it has the ﬁnancial staying power not 
only to have the service network in place when the sale is made but to 
keep it there in the future. Furthermore, while all these inﬂuences have 
made it difﬁcult in the past for the newcomer with an exciting product 
to establish real leadership in most subdivisions of the electronics indus-
try, although a few companies have done so, it is likely to be still more  
difﬁcult in the future. This is because the semiconductor is becoming a 
larger and larger percentage of both the total content and the total tech-
nical  know-how  of  more  and  more  products. The  leading  companies 
making these devices also now have at least as much in-house knowl-
edge  as  the  top  old-line  computer  and  instrument  companies  if  they 
elect to compete in many new product areas that are largely electronic.  
A case in point is the dramatic success of Texas Instruments in the sen- 
sationally growing area of hand-held calculators and the difﬁculties of 
some of the early pioneers in this ﬁeld. 

However, notice how the balance changes if, instead of just a tech- 
nology based on electronic hardware and software, producing the prod-
uct calls for these skills to be combined with some quite different ones 
such  as  nucleonics  or  some  highly  specialized  area  of  chemistry. The 
large  electronic  companies  simply  do  not  have  the  in-house  skills  to 
enter  these  interdisciplinary  technologies.  This  affords  the  best-run 
innovators a far better opportunity to build themselves into the type of 
leadership position in their particular product line that carries with it  
the  broad  proﬁt  margin  that  tends  to  continue  as  long  as  managerial 
competence does not weaken. I believe that some of these multidisci- 
plinary technological companies, in not all of which is electronics a sig- 
niﬁcant factor, have recently proven some of the ﬁnest opportunities for 
truly farsighted investing. I am inclined to think that more such oppor- 
tunities will occur in the future. Thus, for example, I suspect that some-
time in the future new leading companies will arise through products 
or processes that utilize some of these other disciplines combined with 
biology, although so far I have not seen any company in this area that so 
qualiﬁes. This is not to say that none exists. 

Technological development and scale are not the only aspects of a 
company’s activities in which unusual circumstances may raise opportu- 
nities for sustained high proﬁt margins. In certain circumstances these 

The Third Dimension 

2 0 5 

can also occur in the area of marketing or sales. An example is a company 
that has created in its customers the habit of almost automatically spec- 
ifying its products for reorder in a way that makes it rather uneconom-
ical for a competitor to attempt to displace them. Two sets of conditions 
are necessary for this to happen. First, the company must build up a rep- 
utation for quality and reliability in a product (a) that the customer rec- 
ognizes  is  very  important  for  the  proper  conduct  of  his  activities,  
(b)  where  an  inferior  or  malfunctioning  product  would  cause  serious 
problems, (c) where no competitor is serving more than a minor seg-
ment  of  the  market  so  that  the  dominant  company  is  nearly  synony- 
mous in the public mind with the source of supply, and yet (d) the cost 
of the product is only a quite small part of the customer’s total cost of 
operations.  Consequently,  moderate  price  reductions  yield  only  very 
small savings in relation to the risk of taking a chance on an unknown  
supplier.  However,  even  this  is  not  enough  to  ensure  that  a  company 
fortunate  enough  to  get  itself  in  this  position  will  be  able  to  enjoy 
above-average  proﬁt  margins  year  after  year.  Second,  it  must  have  a 
product  sold  to  many  small  customers  rather  than  a  few  large  ones.  
These customers must be sufﬁciently specialized in their nature that it  
would  be  unlikely  for  a  potential  competitor  to  feel  they  could  be 
reached through advertising media such as magazines or television. They 
constitute a market in which, as long as the dominant company main-
tains the quality of its product and the adequacy of its service, it can be 
displaced only by informed salesmen making individual calls. Yet the size 
of each customer’s orders make such a selling effort totally uneconom-
ical! A company possessing all these advantages can, through marketing, 
maintain  an  above-average  proﬁt  margin  almost  indeﬁnitely  unless  a 
major shift in technology (or, as already mentioned, a slippage in its own 
efﬁciency) should displace it. Companies of this type can most often be 
found  in  the  moderately  high  technology  supply  area.  One  of  their 
characteristics is to maintain their image of leadership by holding fre-
quent technical seminars on the use of their product, a marketing tool 
that proves highly effective once a company attains this type of position. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  “above-average”  proﬁt  margin  or  
“greater  than  normal”  return  on  investment  need  not  be—in  fact,  
should not be—many times that earned by industry in general to give  
a  company’s  shares  great  investment  appeal.  Actually,  if  the  proﬁt  or 
return on investment is too spectacular, it can be a source of danger, as 
the inducement then becomes almost irresistible for all sorts of compa- 

 
2 0 6  

nies to try to compete so as to get a share of the unusual honey pot. In 
contrast, a proﬁt margin consistently just 2 or 3 percent of sales greater 
than that of the next best competitor is sufﬁcient to ensure a quite out- 
standing investment. 

To summarize the matter of the third dimension of a truly conser- 
vative investment: It is necessary not just to have the quality of person- 
nel discussed in the second dimension but to have had that personnel  
(or  their  predecessors)  steer  the  company  into  areas  of  activity  where 
there are inherent reasons within the economics of the particular busi-
ness so that above-average proﬁtability is not a short-term matter. Put 
simply, the question to ask in regard to this third dimension is: “What 
can  the  particular  company  do  that  others  would  not  be  able  to  do  
about as well?” If the answer is almost nothing, so that, as the business 
gets more prosperous, others can rush in to share in the company’s pros- 
perity on about equal terms, the evidence is conclusive that while the 
company’s stock may be cheap, the investment fails to qualify as to this 
third dimension. 

4

The Fourth Dimension

Price of a Conservative Investment

The  fourth  dimension  of  any  stock  investment  involves  the  price- 

earnings  ratio—that  is,  the  current  price  divided  by  the  earnings  
per  share.  In  the  attempt  to  appraise  whether  the  price-earnings 
ratio  is  in  line  with  a  proper  valuation  for  that  speciﬁc  stock,  trouble 
begins  to  arise.  Most  investors,  including  many  professionals  who  
should know better, become confused on this point because they don’t 
have  a  clear  understanding  of  what  makes  the  price  of  the  particular 
stock  go  up  or  down  by  a  signiﬁcant  amount. This  misunderstanding  
has  resulted  in  losses  in  billions  of  dollars  by  investors  who  ﬁnd  out 
later that they own stocks bought at prices that they never should have 
paid. Even more billions have been lost as investors have sold out, at the 
wrong time and for the wrong reasons, shares they had every reason to 
hold  and  which,  if  held,  would  have  become  extremely  proﬁtable  as 
long-range  investments.  Still  another  result  is  one  that,  if  it  happens 
repeatedly, will seriously impair the ability of deserving corporations to  
obtain  adequate  ﬁnancing,  with  all  that  this  could  mean  in  a  lower 
standard of living for everyone: Every time individual stocks take sick- 
ening  plunges,  another  group  of  badly  burned  investors  places  the  
blame on the system rather than on their own mistakes or those of their 
advisors. They conclude that common stocks of any type are not suit-
able for their savings.

The other side of the coin is that many other investors can be found 
who  over  the  years  have  prospered  mightily  from  holding  the  right 
stocks  for  considerable  periods  of  time. Their  success  may  be  due  to 
understanding  basic  investment  rules.  Or  it  may  be  due  to  just  plain 
good luck. However, the common denominator in this success has been 
the  refusal  to  sell  certain  unusual  high-quality  stocks  simply  because 
each has had such a sharp fast rise that its price-earnings ratio suddenly 
looks high in relation to that to which the investment community had 
become accustomed. 

In view of the importance of all this, it is truly remarkable that so 
few have looked beneath the surface to understand exactly what causes 
these sharp price changes. Yet the law that governs them can be stated 
reasonably  simply:  Every  signiﬁcant  price  move  of  any  individual  common  
stock in relation to stocks as a whole occurs because of a changed appraisal of that 
stock by the ﬁnancial community. 

Let us see how this works in practice. Two years ago company G was 
considered quite ordinary. It had earned $1 per share and was selling at 
ten times earnings, or $10. During these last two years most companies 
in its industry have been showing a downward proﬁt trend. In contrast, 
a series of brilliant new products, combined with better proﬁt margins 
on old products, enabled G company to report $1.40 per share last year 
and $1.82 this year and to give promise of further gains over the next 
several years. Obviously the actions within the company that produced 
the sharp contrast between G’s recent results and those of others in the 
industry could not have started just two years ago but must have been 
going  on  for  some  time;  otherwise  the  operating  economies  and  the  
brilliant  new  products  would  not  have  occurred.  However,  belated 
recognition (i.e., appraisal) of how well G is qualifying in regard to mat-
ters  covered  in  our  discussions  of  the  ﬁrst  three  dimensions  has  now  
caused  the  price-earnings  ratio  to  rise  to  22. When  compared  with  
other stocks showing similar above-average business characteristics and 
comparable growth prospects, this ratio of 22 does not appear at all high. 
Since 22 times $1.82 is $40, here is a stock that has legitimately gone up 
400 percent in two years. Equally important, a record such as G’s is fre-
quently an indication that there is now a functioning management team 
capable of continued growth for many years ahead. Such a growth, even 
at a more modest rate averaging, say, 15 percent in the next decade or 
two, could easily result in proﬁts by that time running into the thou-
sands rather than the hundreds of percent. 

The Fourth Dimension 

2 0 9 

The matter of “appraisal” is the heart of understanding the seeming 
vagaries  of  price-earnings  ratios.  It  should  never  be  forgotten  that  an 
appraisal  is  a  subjective  matter.  It  has  nothing  necessarily  to  do  with  
what is going on in the real world about us. Rather, it results from what 
the person doing the appraising believes is going on, no matter how far 
from the actual facts such a judgment may be. In other words, any indi- 
vidual  stock  does  not  rise  or  fall  at  any  particular  moment  in  time  
because of what is actually happening or will happen to that company.  
It rises or falls according to the current consensus of the ﬁnancial com- 
munity as to what is happening and will happen regardless of how far  
off this consensus may be from what is really occurring or will occur. 

At  this  point  many  pragmatic  individuals  simply  throw  up  their 
hands  in  disbelief.  If  the  huge  price  changes  that  occur  in  individual 
stocks  are  made  solely  because  of  changed  appraisals  by  the  ﬁnancial 
community,  with  these  appraisals  sometimes  completely  at  variance  
with what is going on in the real world of a company’s affairs, what sig- 
niﬁcance  have  the  other  three  dimensions?  Why  bother  with  the 
expertise of business management, scientiﬁc technology, or accounting 
at all? Why not just depend on psychologists? 

The  answer  involves  timing.  Because  of  a  ﬁnancial-community 
appraisal that is at variance with the facts, a stock may sell for a consid- 
erable period for much more or much less than it is intrinsically worth. 
Furthermore, many segments of the ﬁnancial community have the habit 
of playing “follow the leader,” particularly when that leader is one of the 
larger New York City banks. This sometimes means that when an unre- 
alistic appraisal of a stock is already causing it to sell well above what a 
proper recognition of the facts would justify, the stock may stay at this 
too high level for a long period of time. Actually, from this already too 
high a price it may go even higher. 

These wide variations between the ﬁnancial community’s appraisal 
of a stock and the true set of conditions affecting it may last for several 
years.  Always,  however—sometimes  within  months,  sometimes  only 
after a much longer period of time—the bubble bursts. When a stock 
has been selling too high because of unrealistic expectations, sooner or 
later a growing number of stockholders grow tired of waiting. Their sell- 
ing soon more than exhausts the buying power of the small number of 
additional buyers who still have faith in the old appraisal. The stock then 
comes  tumbling  down.  Sometimes  the  new  appraisal  that  follows  is 
quite realistic. Frequently, however, as this re-examination evolves under 

 
2 1 0  

the emotional pressure of falling prices, the negative is overemphasized, 
resulting in a new ﬁnancial-community appraisal that is signiﬁcantly less 
favorable than the facts warrant and that may then prevail for some time. 
However, when this happens, much the same thing occurs as when the 
appraisal  is  too  favorable. The  only  difference  is  that  the  process  is 
reversed. It may take months or years for a more favorable image to sup-
plant the existing one. Nevertheless, as pleasing earnings mount upward, 
sooner or later this happens. 

Fortunate holders—those who don’t sell out as such a stock starts to 
rise—then  beneﬁt  from  the  phenomenon  that  provides  the  greatest 
reward  in  relation  to  the  risk  involved  the  stock  market  can  produce. 
This is the dramatic improvement in price that results from the com-
bined effect of both a steady improvement in per-share earnings and a 
sharp, simultaneous increase in the price-earnings ratio. As the ﬁnancial 
community quite correctly discovers that the fundamentals of the com-
pany (now its new image) have much more investment worth than had 
been recognized when the old image was in effect, the resulting increase 
in the price-earnings ratio is frequently an even more important factor 
in the increased price of the stock than the actual increase in per-share 
earnings that accompanies it. This is precisely what happened in our G- 
company example. 

We are now in a position to begin to get a true perspective on the 
degree  of  conservatism—that  is,  of  basic  risk  in  any  investment.  On  
the lowest end of the risk scale and most suitable for wise investment 
is  the  company  that  measures  quite  high  in  regard  to  the  ﬁrst  three 
dimensions  but  currently  is  appraised  by  the  ﬁnancial  community  as  
less  worthy,  and  therefore  has  a  lower  price-earnings  ratio,  than  these 
fundamental  facts  warrant.  Next  least  risky  and  usually  quite  suitable  
for  intelligent  investment  is  the  company  rating  quite  high  in  regard 
to  the  ﬁrst  three  dimensions  and  having  an  image  and  therefore  a 
price-earnings ratio reasonably in line with these fundamentals. This is  
because  such  a  company  will  continue  to  grow  if  it  truly  has  these  
attributes.  Next  least  risky  and,  in  my  opinion,  usually  suitable  for 
retention  by  conservative  investors  who  own  them  but  not  for  fresh 
purchase  with  new  funds  are  companies  that  are  equally  strong  in  
regard  to  the  ﬁrst  three  dimensions  but,  because  these  qualities  have 
become almost legendary in the ﬁnancial community, have an apprais- 
al or price-earnings ratio higher than is warranted by even the strong 
fundamentals. 

The Fourth Dimension 

2 1 1 

In my opinion there are important reasons such stocks should usu-
ally be retained, even though their prices seem too high: If the funda- 
mentals  are  genuinely  strong,  these  companies  will  in  time  increase 
earnings not only enough to justify present prices but to justify consid- 
erably higher prices. Meanwhile, the number of truly attractive compa- 
nies in regard to the ﬁrst three dimensions is fairly small. Undervalued 
ones are not easy to ﬁnd. The risk of making a mistake and switching 
into one that seems to meet all of the ﬁrst three dimensions but actual- 
ly does not is probably considerably greater for the average investor than 
the  temporary  risk  of  staying  with  a  thoroughly  sound  but  currently 
overvalued situation until genuine value catches up with current prices. 
Investors who agree with me on this particular point must be prepared 
for  occasional  sharp  contractions  in  the  market  value  of  these  tem- 
porarily overvalued stocks. On the other hand, it is my observation that 
those who sell such stocks to wait for a more suitable time to buy back 
these same shares seldom attain their objective. They usually wait for a 
decline to be bigger than it actually turns out to be. The result is that 
some years later when this fundamentally strong stock has reached peaks 
of  value  considerably  higher  than  the  point  at  which  they  sold,  they 
have missed all of this later move and may have gone into a situation of 
considerably inferior intrinsic quality. 

Continuing up our  scale of ascending risks, we come next  to  the 
stocks that are average or relatively low in quality in regard to the ﬁrst 
three  dimensions  but  have  an  appraisal  in  the  ﬁnancial  community  
either lower than, or about in line with, these not very attractive funda- 
mentals. Those  with  a  poorer  appraisal  than  basic  conditions  warrant 
may be good speculations but are not suitable for the prudent investor. 
In  the  fast-moving  world  of  today  there  is  just  too  much  danger  of 
adverse developments severely affecting such shares. 

Finally we come to what is by far the most dangerous group of all: 
companies  with  a  present  ﬁnancial-community  appraisal  or  image  far 
above what is currently justiﬁed by the immediate situation. Purchase of 
such  shares  can  cause  the  sickening  losses  that  tend  to  drive  investors 
away from stock ownership in droves and threaten to shake the invest-
ment industry to its foundations. If anyone wants to make a case-by-case 
study of the contrast between the ﬁnancial-community appraisals that 
prevailed at one time about some quite colorful companies and the fun- 
damental conditions that subsequently came to light, he will ﬁnd plen- 
ty of material in a business library or the ﬁles of the larger Wall Street 

 
2 1 2  

houses.  It  is  alarming  to  read  some  of  the  reasons  given  in  brokerage 
reports  recommending  purchase  of  these  shares  and  then  to  compare  
the  outlook  described  in  such  documents  with  what  actually  was  to 
happen. A fragmentary list of such companies might include: Memorex 
high  1737⁄8, Ampex  high  497⁄8,  Levitz  Furniture  high  60½,  Mohawk  
Data  Sciences  high  111,  Litton  Industries  high  101¾,  Kalvar  high  
176½. 

The  list  could  go  on  and  on  and  on.  However,  more  examples  
would serve only to make the same point over and over. Since it should 
already be quite apparent how important is the habit of evaluating any 
difference that may exist between a contemporary ﬁnancial-communi- 
ty appraisal of a company and the fundamental aspects of that company, 
it should be more productive for us to spend our time examining fur-
ther  the  characteristics  of  these  ﬁnancial-community  appraisals.  First, 
however, to avoid risk of misunderstanding, it seems advisable to avoid 
semantic confusion by deﬁning two of the words in our original state-
ment of the rule governing all major changes in the price of common 
stocks: Every signiﬁcant price move of any individual common stock in relation 
to stocks as a whole occurs because of a changed appraisal of that stock by the 
ﬁnancial community. 

The  phrase “signiﬁcant  price  changes”  is  used  rather  than  merely 
“price  changes.” This  is  to  exclude  the  kind  of  minor  price  variation 
that occurs if, say, an estate has twenty thousand shares of a stock that a 
clumsy  broker  rapidly  dumps  on  the  market  with  the  result  that  the 
stock drops a point or two and then usually recovers as the liquidation 
ends. Similarly, at times an institution will determine that on going into  
a new situation it must buy a minimum number of shares. The result is  
frequently  a  small  onetime  bulge  that  subsides  on  completion  of  this  
sort  of  buying.  Such  moves,  in  the  absence  of  a  genuinely  changed 
appraisal of the company by the ﬁnancial community as a whole, have 
no  important  or  long-term  effect  on  the  price  of  the  shares.  Usually  
such  small  price  changes  disappear  once  the  special  buying  or  selling  
is over. 

The term “ﬁnancial community” has been used to include all those 
able and enough interested to be potentially ready to buy or sell a par- 
ticular stock at some price, keeping in mind that, with regard to impact 
on price, the importance of each of these potential buyers and sellers is 
weighted by the amount of buying or selling power each is in a posi- 
tion to exercise.

More about  
the Fourth Dimension

Up to this point our discussion of the ﬁnancial community’s apprais- 

al of a stock may have given the impression that this appraisal is 
nothing more than an evaluation of that particular equity, consid- 
ered by itself. This is oversimpliﬁcation. Actually it always results from 
the blending of three separate appraisals: the current ﬁnancial-commu- 
nity appraisal of the attractiveness of common stocks as a whole, of the 
industry of which the particular company is a part, and, ﬁnally, of the 
company itself. 

Let  us  ﬁrst  examine  the  matter  of  industry  appraisals.  Everyone 
knows that, over long periods of time, there can be a sizable decline in 
the price-earnings ratio the ﬁnancial community will pay to participate 
in an industry as it passes from an early stage when huge markets appear 
ahead to a much later period where it, in turn, may be threatened by  
new technologies. Thus, in the early years of the electronics industry,  
companies  making  electronic  tubes,  in  that  period  the  fundamental  
building block of all electronics, sold at very high price-earnings ratios. 
Then  price-earnings  ratios  shrank  drastically  as  the  development  of 
semiconductors steadily narrowed the tube market. Makers of magnetic 
memory devices have more recently suffered the same fate for the same 
reason. All  this  is  obvious  and  thoroughly  understood. What  is  not  so 
obvious or comparably understood is how the image of an industry can  
rise or fall in ﬁnancial-community status, not because of such overpow- 
ering inﬂuences as these but because at a given time the ﬁnancial com- 
munity is stressing one particular set of industry background inﬂuences 
rather than another. Yet both sets of background conditions may have 

2 1 3

2 1 4  

been quite valid for some time, and both may give every indication of 
continuing to be for the reasonable future. 

The chemical industry may be cited as an example. From the depths 
of the Great Depression until the middle 1950s, the shares of the largest 
U.S. chemical companies sold at quite high price-earnings ratios com-
pared  to  most  other  stocks. The  ﬁnancial  community’s  idea  of  these  
companies  might  have  been  depicted  in  a  cartoon  as  an  endless  con- 
veyor belt. At one end were scientists making breathtaking new com-
pounds  in  test  tubes.  After  passing  through  mysterious  and  hard-to- 
imitate factories, these materials came out at the other end as fabulous 
new products such as nylon, DDT, synthetic rubber, quick-drying paint,  
and endless other new materials that seemed sure to be an ever-increas- 
ing source of wealth for their fortunate producers. Then, as the 1960s 
arrived,  the  image  changed. The  chemical  industry,  to  the  investment 
community, came to resemble steel or cement or paper in that it was 
selling  bulk  commodities  on  a  basis  of  technical  speciﬁcation  so  that 
Jones’s  chemicals  were  more  or  less  identical  with  Smith’s.  Capital- 
intensive industries usually are under major pressure to operate at high 
rates of capacity in order to amortize their large ﬁxed investments. The 
result is frequently intense price competition and narrowing proﬁt mar-
gins. This changed image caused the shares of the major chemical com-
panies to sell at signiﬁcantly lower price-earnings ratios  in relation  to 
stocks as a whole in the, say, ten-year period that ended in 1972 than 
they had in the past. While still considerably higher than in many indus-
tries,  chemical  price-earnings  ratios  started  more  closely  to  resemble 
those of industries like steel, paper, and cement. 

Now the remarkable thing about all this is that with one important 
exception there was little or nothing different in the fundamental back-
ground of this industry in the 1960s than there was in the prior thirty 
years. It is true that in the latter half of the 1960s there was a serious glut 
of capacity in certain areas such as the manufacture of most synthetic 
textile products. This was a major temporary depressant of the earnings 
of certain of the leading chemical companies, particularly DuPont. But 
the  basic  characteristics  of  the  industry  had  in  no  way  changed  sufﬁ-
ciently to account for this rather drastic change in the industry’s status  
in  the  ﬁnancial  community.  Chemical  manufacture  always  had  been  
capital-intensive.  Most  products  had  always  been  sold  on  a  technical 
speciﬁcation basis so that Jones could seldom raise his price above Smith’s. 
On the other hand, as a host of new and greatly improved pesticides,  

More about the Fourth Dimension  

2 1 5 

packaging  materials,  textiles,  drugs,  and  countless  other  products  have 
shown,  the  1960s  and  the  1970s  have  afforded  this  industry  an  ever- 
expanding  market.  Opportunities  seem  almost  limitless  for  human  
brains  to  rearrange  molecules  so  as  to  create  products  not  found  in 
nature that will have special properties to cater to the needs of man bet- 
ter or more cheaply than the previously used natural materials. 

Finally, in both the previous period of higher and the more recent 
period  of  lower  esteem  for  chemical  stocks,  still  another  factor  had 
remained  almost  constant.  The  older  and  larger-volume  chemical  
products, representing in a sense the “ﬁrst step” processing of tailored 
materials from such basic sources of molecules as salt or hydrocarbons,  
were inevitably products sold mainly by speciﬁcation and on a price- 
competitive basis. Nevertheless, for the alert company there always was 
and continued to be the opportunity to process these ﬁrst-step prod- 
ucts into much more complicated and higher-priced ones. These, at 
least for a while, could be sold on a much more proprietary and there-
fore  less  competitive  basis. As  these  products  in  turn  become  price 
competitive, the alert companies have consistently found still newer 
ones to add to the higher-proﬁt-margin end of their lines. 

In  other  words,  all  the  favorable  factors,  so  much  in  the  ﬁnancial 
community’s mind when chemical stocks were darlings of the market, 
continued  to  be  there  after  they  had  lost  considerable  status.  But  the 
unfavorable factors so much in the forefront in the 1960s were also there 
in the earlier period when they were largely ignored. What had shifted 
was the emphasis, not the facts. 

But the facts, too, can change. Starting about the middle of 1973, 
chemical stocks began regaining favor in the ﬁnancial community. This 
was because a new view of the industry was starting to prevail. In the  
scarcity-plagued economy the major industrial nations have been expe- 
riencing for the ﬁrst time (except during major wars) in modern times, 
manufacturing capacity can be increased only gradually; hence, it may 
be years before cutthroat price competition will occur again. This image 
opens up a whole new ballgame for the investor in chemical stocks. The 
problem  for  investors  now  becomes  one  of  determining  whether  the 
background facts warrant the new image and, if they do, whether chem-
ical stocks, in relation to the market as a whole, have risen more than or 
not as much as may be warranted by the new situation. 

Recent  ﬁnancial  history  offers  countless  other  examples  of  much 
larger changes in price-earnings ratios that occurred because the  ﬁnancial  

 
2 1 6  

community’s  appraisal  of  the  industry’s  background  changed  radically 
while the industry itself remained almost exactly the same. In 1969 the 
computer  peripheral  stocks  were  great  market  favorites. These  were  
the companies making all the special equipment that could be added to 
the central computing unit or mainframe of a computer to increase the 
user’s beneﬁts from that central unit. High-speed printers, extra memo- 
ry units, and keyboard devices to eliminate the need for keypunch oper-
ators in getting data into a computer were some of the major products 
in this group. The prevailing image then was that these companies had 
an almost limitless future. While the central computer itself was largely 
developed and its market would be dominated by a few strong, estab-
lished companies, the small independent would be able to undercut the 
big companies in these peripheral areas. Today there is a new awareness 
of the ﬁnancial strain on small companies with products that are usual- 
ly leased rather than sold and of the determination of the major com-
puter mainframe manufacturers to ﬁght for the market of the products 
“hung on” their equipment. Have the fundamentals changed or is it the 
appraisal of the fundamentals that has changed? 

An  extreme  case  of  a  changed  appraisal  is  the  way  in  which  the 
ﬁnancial  community  looked  on  the  fundamentals  of  the  franchising 
business and franchise stocks in 1969 in contrast to 1972. Here again, as  
with computer peripheral stocks, all the problems of the industry were 
inherently  there  when  these  stocks  were  being  bought  at  such  high  
price-earnings  ratios  but  were  being  overlooked  when  the  prevailing 
image was one of uninterrupted growth for the company momentarily 
doing well. 

In  this  whole  matter  of  industry  image,  the  investor’s  problem  is 
always the same. Is the current prevailing appraisal one more favorable,  
less favorable, or about the same as that warranted by the basic economic  
facts?  At  times  this  can  present  an  acute  problem  to  even  the  most 
sophisticated investors. One example occurred in December 1958 when 
Smith,  Barney  &  Co.,  traditionally  conservative  investment  bankers,  
took  a  pioneering  step  that  seems  purely  routine  today  but  appeared 
quite  the  contrary  at  that  time: They  made  a  public  offering  of  the  
equity shares of the A. C. Nielsen Co. This company had no factories,  
no tangible product, and therefore no inventories. Instead it was in the  
“service  business,”  receiving  fees  for  supplying  market-research  infor- 
mation to its customers. It was true that in 1958 banks and insurance 
companies had long been well regarded in the marketplace as  industries 

More about the Fourth Dimension  

2 1 7 

worthy of conservative investment. However, such industries were hard- 
ly comparable. Since the book value of a bank or insurance company is  
in cash, liquid investments or accounts receivable, the investor buying a  
bank or insurance stock seemed to have a hard core of value to fall back  
on that did not exist for this new kind of service company being intro- 
duced  to  the  ﬁnancial  public.  However,  investigation  of  the  A.  C.  
Nielsen situation revealed unusually good fundamentals. There was an 
honest and capable management, a uniquely strong competitive position 
and good prospects for many years of further growth. Nevertheless, until 
experience showed how the ﬁnancial community would react to its ﬁrst 
exposure to this kind of an industry, there did appear to be some reason  
for hesitation in buying. Would it take years for a realistic appraisal of the  
investment worth of such a company to displace the fear that might be 
engendered by the lack of some of the familiar yardsticks of value? It 
may seem ridiculous today, when for many years a company like A. C. 
Nielsen has enjoyed a price-earnings ratio signifying a very high invest-
ment  appraisal,  but  some  of  us  who  decided  to  take  a  chance  on  the 
fundamentals  being  recognized  and  bought  these  shares  at  that  time 
experienced a sensation almost like stepping off a cliff and seeing if the 
air would support us, so new was the concept of a service company in 
contrast to concepts to which we were accustomed. Actually within a 
few years the pendulum swung quite the other way. As A. C. Nielsen’s 
proﬁts grew and grew, a new concept arose in Wall Street. A large num-
ber of companies, many quite different in economic fundamentals but 
all dealing in services rather than products, were lumped together in a 
ﬁnancial-community image as parts of a highly attractive service indus-
try. Some began selling at higher price-earnings ratios than they might 
have deserved. As always, in time, fundamentals dominated, and this false 
image  formed  by  lumping  quite  different  companies  into  one  group 
faded away. 

This  point  cannot  be  overstressed:  The  conservative  investor  must  be 
aware of the nature of the current ﬁnancial-community appraisal of any industry  
in which he is interested. He should constantly be probing to see whether 
that appraisal is signiﬁcantly more or less favorable than the fundamen- 
tals warrant. Only by judging properly on this point can he be reason- 
ably sure about one of the three variables that will govern the long-term 
trend of market price of stocks of that industry. 

 
6

Still More about  
the Fourth Dimension

The ﬁnancial community’s appraisal of a company’s own characteris- 

tics  is  an  even  more  important  factor  in  the  price-earnings  ratio  
than  is  the  appraisal  of  the  industry  in  which  the  company  is  
engaged. The most desirable investment traits of individual companies 
have been deﬁned in our discussion of the ﬁrst three dimensions of a  
conservative investment. In general, the more closely the ﬁnancial com- 
munity’s appraisal of a particular stock approaches these characteristics, 
the higher will be its price-earnings ratio. To the degree by which it falls 
below these standards, the price-earnings ratio will tend to decline. The 
investor can best determine which stocks are importantly undervalued 
or overvalued by a shrewd determination of the degree to which the  
real facts concerning any particular company present an investment sit- 
uation signiﬁcantly better or signiﬁcantly worse than that painted by the 
current ﬁnancial image of that company. 

In making a determination as to the relative attractiveness of two or 
more stocks, investors often confuse themselves by attempting too sim-
ple  a  mathematical  approach  to  such  a  problem.  Let  us  suppose,  for 
example,  they  compare  two  companies,  the  proﬁts  of  each  of  which, 
after  careful  study,  appear  to  afford  prospects  of  growing  at  a  rate  of  
10 percent a year. If one is selling at ten times earnings and the other at 
twenty times, the stock selling at ten times earnings appears cheaper. It 
may be. It also may not be. There can be a number of reasons for this. 
The seemingly cheaper company may have such a leveraged capitaliza- 
tion  (interest  charges  and  preferred  dividends  that  must  be  earned  
before anything accrues to the common-stock holder) that the danger 

2 1 8

Still More about the Fourth Dimension  

2 1 9 

of interruption of the expected growth rate may be much greater in the 
lower  price-earnings-ratio  stock.  Similarly,  for  purely  business  reasons, 
while the growth rate would seem a most probable estimate for both 
stocks, nevertheless the chance of the unexpected upsetting these esti-
mates may be considerably more for the one stock than for the other. 

Another far more important and far less understood way to reach 
wrong conclusions is to rely too much on simple comparisons of the 
price-earnings  ratios  of  stocks  that  seem  to  be  offering  comparable 
opportunities for growth. To illustrate this, let us assume that there are 
two  stocks  with  an  equally  strong  prospect  of  doubling  earnings  over 
the next four years and that both are selling at twenty times earnings, 
while  in  the  same  market  companies  which  are  sound  otherwise  but 
have no growth prospects are selling at ten times earnings. Let us sup-
pose that four years later the price-earnings ratios of stocks as a whole 
are unchanged so that generally sound stocks, but ones with no growth 
prospects, are still selling at ten times earnings. Let us also suppose that  
at this same time, four years later, one of our two stocks has much the 
same growth prospects for the time ahead as it had four years before so 
that the ﬁnancial community’s appraisal is that this stock should again 
double its earnings over the next four years. This means it would still be 
selling at twenty times the doubled earnings of the past four years, or, in 
other words, that it had also doubled in price in that period. In contrast, 
at this same time, four years after our example had started, the second 
stock  had  also  doubled  its  earnings,  just  as  had  been  expected,  but  at  
this point the ﬁnancial community’s appraisal is for ﬂat earnings in an 
otherwise sound company over the next four years. This would mean 
that owners of this second stock were in for a market disappointment 
even  though  the  four-year  doubling  of  earnings  had  come  through 
exactly  as  forecast. With  an  image  of “no  growth  in  earnings  for  the  
next  four  years.”  they  would  now  be  seeing  a  price-earnings  ratio  of  
only ten in this second stock. Therefore, while the earnings had dou- 
bled, the price of the stock had remained the same. All this can be sum- 
marized  in  a  basic  investment  rule:The  further  into  the  future  proﬁts 
will  continue  to  grow,  the  higher  the  price-earnings  ratio  an  investor 
can afford to pay. 

This rule, however, should be applied with great caution. It should 
never be forgotten that the actual variations in price-earnings ratio will 
result not from what will actually happen but from what the ﬁnancial 
community currently believes will happen. In a period of general market 

 
2 2 0  

optimism  a  stock  may  sell  at  an  extremely  high  price-earnings  ratio 
because the ﬁnancial community quite correctly envisages many years 
of great growth ahead. But many years will have to elapse before this 
growth is fully realized. The great growth that had been correctly dis-
counted in the price-earnings ratio is likely to become “undiscounted” 
for a while, particularly if the company experiences the type of tempo- 
rary  setback  that  is  not  uncommon  for  even  the  best  of  companies. 
In times of general market pessimism, this kind of “undiscounting” of 
some  of  the  very  ﬁnest  investments  can  reach  rather  extreme  levels. 
When it does, it affords the patient investor, with the ability to distin- 
guish between current market image and true facts, some of the most 
attractive opportunities common stocks can offer for handsome long-
term proﬁts at relatively small risk. 

A rather colorful example of how sophisticated investors attempt to 
anticipate  a  changed  investment-community  appraisal  of  a  company 
occurred  on  March  13,  1974. The  previous  day  the  New York  Stock 
Exchange closing price of Motorola was 485⁄8. On March 13 the clos-
ing quotation was 60, a gain of almost 25 percent! What had happened 
was that after the close of the exchange on the 12th, an announcement 
was made that Motorola was getting out of the television business and 
was selling its U.S. television plants and inventory to Matsushita, a large 
Japanese manufacturer, for approximate book value. 

Now it had been known generally that Motorola’s television busi-
ness  was  operating  at  a  small  loss  and  to  that  extent  was  draining  the 
proﬁts of the rest of the company’s business. This of itself would warrant 
the  news  to  cause  some  increase  in  the  price  of  the  shares,  although  
hardly  the  degree  of  rise  that  actually  occurred.  Considerably  more 
complex  reasoning  was  the  main  motivation  behind  the  buying.  For 
some time a considerable body of investors had believed that Motorola’s 
proﬁtable divisions, particularly its Communications Division, made this 
company one of the very few American electronics companies qualiﬁed 
as  being  of  truly  high-grade  investment  status.  For  example,  Spencer 
Trask and Co. had issued a report by security analyst Otis Bradley that 
discussed  the  investment  merits  of  Motorola’s  Communications  Divi-
sion in considerable detail. This report took the unusual approach of cal- 
culating the current and estimated future price-earnings ratio, not for 
Motorola’s earnings as a whole but merely for this one division alone.  
The  report  compared  the  estimated  sales  volume  and  price-earnings 
ratio  of  just  this  one  division  with  those  of  Hewlett-Packard  and  

Still More about the Fourth Dimension  

2 2 1 

Perkin-Elmer, generally considered to be among the very ﬁnest of elec- 
tronics companies from an investment standpoint. From the report the 
inference could easily be drawn (this was not speciﬁcally stated) that the 
investment  quality  of  Motorola’s  Communications  Division  was  such 
that it was worth, by itself, the then current price of Motorola shares so 
that, in effect, a buyer of the stock was getting all the other divisions for 
nothing. 

With this opinion about Motorola existing in some highly sophis- 
ticated places, what may be judged to have induced such eager buying 
on the Matsushita news? These Motorola enthusiasts had long known 
that many elements of the ﬁnancial community were inclined to look 
with  disfavor  on  the  stock  because  of  its  television-manufacturing 
image. Most of the ﬁnancial community, upon hearing “Motorola.” ﬁrst 
thought  of  television  and  secondly  of  semiconductors. At  the  time  of 
the  Matsushita  announcement,  Standard  &  Poor’s  stock  guide,  in  the 
small amount of space available for listing the principal business of each 
company, described Motorola as “Radio & T.V.: semiconductors.” all of 
which, though not inaccurate, was misleading in that it suggested a dif- 
ferent sort of company from what, in fact, Motorola really was and com- 
pletely  overlooked  the  very  important  Communications  Division,  
which at the time comprised almost half of the company. 

Some of those buying Motorola on the Matsushita news undoubt-
edly rushed in merely because the news was good and therefore could 
be expected to send the stock up. But there is reason to ascribe consid- 
erable buying to the belief that the ﬁnancial community’s appraisal of 
the company  had been  considerably  less  favorable than the facts war-
ranted. The  historical  record  was  such  that  in  the  television  business 
Motorola was regarded more as an “also ran” than as an industry leader 
such  as  Zenith.  With  the  television  operations  no  longer  blurring  
investors’ vision of what else was there, a new image with a very much 
higher price-earnings ratio would arise. 

Were those who rushed in to pay these higher prices for Motorola 
wise in so doing? Not entirely. In subsequent weeks the shares lost the 
immediate gain so that a degree of patience would have paid. In down-
ward  markets,  a  change  for  the  worse  in  the  ﬁnancial  community’s  
image of a company gets accepted far more quickly than a change for 
the better. Just the opposite is true in rising markets. Unfortunately for 
those  who  rushed  in  to  buy  Motorola  on  this  news,  the  immediately 
ensuing  weeks  saw  a  sharp  upturn  in  short-term  interest  rates  which 

 
2 2 2  

produced a downward trend in the general market and accentuated the 
widespread bear-market psychology then prevailing. 

Perhaps  another  inﬂuence  was  also  at  work  against  those  who 
snapped up Motorola shares overnight. This inﬂuence is one of the most 
subtle and dangerous in the entire ﬁeld of investment and one against 
which  even  the  most  sophisticated  investors  must  constantly  be  on 
guard. When for a long period of time a particular stock has been sell-
ing in a certain price range, say from a low of 38 to a high of 43, there  
is  an  almost  irresistible  tendency  to  attribute  true  value  to  this  price 
level.  Consequently,  when,  after  the  ﬁnancial  community  has  become 
thoroughly  accustomed  to  this  being  the  “value”  of  the  stock,  the 
appraisal changes and the stock, say, sinks to 24, all sorts of buyers who 
should know better rush in to buy. They jump to the conclusion that 
the stock must now be cheap. Yet if the fundamentals are bad enough,  
it may still be very high at 24. Conversely, as such a stock rises to, say,  
50 or 60 or 70, the urge to sell and take a proﬁt now that the stock is 
“high” becomes irresistible to many people. Giving in to this urge can 
be very costly. This is because the genuinely worthwhile proﬁts in stock 
investing  have  come  from  holding  the  surprisingly  large  number  of 
stocks that have gone up many times from their original cost. The only 
true test of whether a stock is “cheap” or “high” is not its current price  
in relation to some former price, no matter how accustomed we may 
have become to that former price, but whether the company’s funda- 
mentals are signiﬁcantly more or less favorable than the current ﬁnancial- 
community appraisal of that stock. 

As  previously  mentioned,  there  is  a  third  element  of  investment- 
community  appraisal  that  also  must  be  considered,  along  with  its 
appraisal of the industry and of the particular company. Only after all 
three are blended together can a worthwhile judgment be reached as to 
whether a stock is cheap or high at any given time. This third appraisal 
is that of the outlook for stocks in general. To see the rather extreme 
effect  such  general  market  appraisals  can  have  in  certain  periods  and 
how far these views can vary from the facts, it may be well to review  
the two most extreme such appraisals of this century. Ridiculous as it  
may seem to us today, in the period from 1927 to 1929, the majority of  
the ﬁnancial community actually believed we were in a “new era.” For 
years earnings of most U.S. companies had been growing with monot- 
onous  regularity.  Not  only  had  serious  business  depressions  become  a 
thing of the past but a great engineer and businessman, Herbert Hoover, 

Still More about the Fourth Dimension  

2 2 3 

had  been  elected  President.  His  competence  was  expected  to  assure  
even greater prosperity from then on. In such circumstances it seemed  
to  many  that  it  had  become  virtually  impossible  to  lose  by  owning 
stocks. And many who wanted to cash in as much as possible on this sure 
thing bought on margin to obtain more shares than they could other- 
wise  afford. We  all  know  what  happened  when  reality  shattered  this 
particular  appraisal. The  agony  of  the  Great  Depression  and  the  bear 
market of 1929 to 1932 will be long remembered. 

Contrary in outlook, but similar in being spectacularly wrong, was 
the investment community’s appraisal of common stocks as an invest-
ment  vehicle  in  the  three  years  from  mid-1946  to  mid-1949.  Most 
companies’ earnings were extremely pleasing. However, pursuant to the 
then current appraisal, stocks were selling at the lowest price-earnings 
ratios  in  many  years. The  ﬁnancial  community  was  saying  that “these 
earnings  don’t  mean  anything.”  that  they  were  “just  temporary  and 
would shrink sharply or disappear in the depression that must come.” 
The ﬁnancial community remembered that the Civil War had been fol-
lowed by the panic of 1873, which marked the onset of a very severe 
depression that lasted until 1879. Following World War I had come the 
even  worse  crash  of  1929  and  another  six  years  of  major  depression. 
Since World War II had involved a vastly greater effort and therefore a 
greater distortion of the economy than World War I, it was assumed that 
an even bigger bear market and an even worse depression were on the 
horizon. As long as this appraisal lasted, most stocks were so much on  
the  bargain  counter  that  when  it  began  to  dawn  on  the  investment 
community that this image was false and that no severe depression lay 
in wait, the foundations had been laid for one of the longest periods of 
rising stock prices in U.S. history. 

Since the bear market of 1972–1974 brought with it the only other 
time in this century when most price-earnings ratios were about as low as 
they were in the 1946–1949 period, the question obviously arises as to the 
soundness of the ﬁnancial community’s appraisal that brought this about.  
Are the fears engendering these historically low price-earnings ratios valid? 
Could this be another 1946–1949 all over again? An attempt will be made 
to throw some light on these matters in a later section of this book. 

There is a basic difference between the factors that affect changes in 
the general level of all stock prices and those that affect the relative price- 
earnings  ratio  of  one  stock  compared  to  another  within  that  general  
level. For reasons already discussed, the factors at any given moment that 

 
2 2 4  

affect this relative price-earnings ratio of one stock to another are sole- 
ly  matters  of  the  current  image  in  the  investment  community  of  the 
particular company and the particular industry to which that company 
belongs. However, the level of stocks as a whole is not solely a matter of 
image but results partly from the ﬁnancial community’s current apprais- 
al of the degree of attractiveness of common stocks and partly from a 
certain purely ﬁnancial factor from the real world. 

This real-world factor is mainly involved with interest rates. When 
interest rates are high in either the long- or short-term money markets, 
and even more so when they are high in both, there is a tendency for a  
larger part of the pool of investment capital to ﬂow toward those markets, 
so the demand for stocks is less. Stocks may be sold to transfer funds to 
these markets. Conversely, when rates are low, funds ﬂow out of those 
markets and into stocks. Therefore, higher interest rates tend to lower the  
level of all stocks and lower interest rates to raise that level. Similarly, when 
the public is in a mood to save a larger percentage of its income, more 
funds ﬂow into the total capital pool and there is a more bullish pull on 
stock prices than when the pool of capital funds is rising more slowly.  
However, this is a much smaller inﬂuence than is the level of interest rates. 
An even smaller inﬂuence is the degree of ﬂuctuation in new stock issues, 
which are a drain on the capital pool available to the stock market. The 
reason the new-issue supply is not a bigger factor on the general level of 
stock prices is that when other inﬂuences cause stocks to be in favor, the 
new-issue volume rises to take advantage of this situation. When com-
mon-stock prices reach low levels, supply of new issues tends to diminish 
drastically. As a result, ﬂuctuations in new-issue volume are much more a 
result of other inﬂuences than an inﬂuencing factor themselves. 

This fourth dimension to stock investing might be summarized in 
this way: The price of any particular stock at any particular moment is 
determined by the current ﬁnancial-community appraisal of the partic- 
ular company, of the industry it is in, and to some degree of the gener- 
al level of stock prices. Determining whether at that moment the price 
of a stock is attractive, unattractive or somewhere in between depends  
for  the  most  part  on  the  degree  these  appraisals  vary  from  reality. 
However, to the extent that the general level of stock prices affects the 
total picture, it also depends somewhat on correctly estimating coming 
changes in certain purely ﬁnancial factors, of which interest rates are by 
far the most important.

Origins of a Philosophy

To understand any disciplined approach to investment, it is ﬁrst nec- 

essary  to  understand  the  objective  for  which  the  methodology  is 
designed.  For  any  part  of  the  funds  supervised  by  Fisher  &  Co., 
except for funds temporarily in cash or cash equivalents awaiting more 
suitable opportunities, it is the objective that they be invested in a very 
small number of companies that, because of the characteristics of their 
management, should both grow in sales and more importantly in prof- 
its at a rate signiﬁcantly greater than industry as a whole. They should 
also do so at relatively small risk in relation to the growth involved. To 
meet Fisher & Co. standards, a management must have a viable policy  
for attaining these ends with all the willingness to subordinate immedi- 
ate proﬁts for the greater long-range gains that this concept requires. In 
addition, two characteristics are necessary. One is the ability to imple-
ment long-range policy with superior day-to-day performance in all the 
routine  tasks  of  business  operation. The  other  is  that  when  signiﬁcant 
mistakes occur, as is bound at times to happen when management strives 
for unique beneﬁts through innovative concepts, new products, etc., or 
because  management  becomes  too  complacent  through  success,  these 
mistakes are recognized clearly and remedial action is taken. 

Because I believe I best understand the characteristics of manufac- 
turing  companies,  I  have  conﬁned  Fisher  &  Co.  activities  largely  to  
manufacturing enterprises that use a combination of leading edge tech- 
nology  and  superior  business  judgment  to  accomplish  these  goals.  In 
recent  years,  I  have  conﬁned  Fisher  &  Co.  investments  solely  to  this 
group, because on the few occasions when I have invested outside it, 

2 2 7

2 2 8  

I have not been satisﬁed with the results. However, I see no reason why  
the same principles should not be equally proﬁtable when applied by 
those with the necessary expertise in such ﬁelds as retailing, transporta- 
tion, ﬁnance, etc. 

No investment philosophy, unless it is just a carbon copy of some-
one  else’s  approach,  develops  in  its  complete  form  in  any  one  day  or  
year. In my own case, it grew over a considerable period of time, partly  
as a result of what perhaps may be called logical reasoning, and partly 
from  observing  the  successes  and  failures  of  others,  but  much  of  it 
through the more painful method of learning from my own mistakes. 
Possibly the best way of trying to explain my investment approach to 
others is to use the historical route. For this reason I will go back into 
the early, formative years, attempting to show block by block how this 
investment philosophy developed. 

THE BIRTH OF INTEREST 

My  ﬁrst  awareness  of  the  stock  market  and  the  opportunities  which 
changing stock quotations might make possible occurred at a fairly early 
age. With my father the youngest of ﬁve and my mother the youngest 
of  eight,  at  my  birth  I  had  only  one  surviving  grandparent. This  may 
have been one of the reasons why I felt particularly close to my grand-
mother. At any rate, I went to see her one afternoon when I was bare- 
ly out of grammar school. An uncle dropped in to discuss with her his 
views of business conditions in the year ahead, and how this might affect 
the stocks she owned. A whole new world opened up to me. By saving 
some money, I had the right to buy a share in the future proﬁts of any 
one  I  might  choose  among  hundreds  of  the  most  important  business 
enterprises  of  the  country.  If  I  chose  correctly,  these  proﬁts  could  be 
truly  exciting.  I  thought  the  whole  subject  of  judging  what  makes  a 
business grow an intriguing one, and here was a game that if I learned  
to play it properly would by comparison make any other with which I  
was  familiar  seem  drab,  meaningless  and  unexciting. When  my  uncle 
left, my grandmother turned to me and said how sorry she was that he  
happened to come in when I was there, forcing her to spend time on 
matters which could not possibly interest me. I told her that, to the con- 
trary, the hour he spent with her had seemed like ten minutes, and that  
I had just heard something that interested me tremendously. Years later 

Origins of a Philosophy 

2 2 9 

I  was  to  realize  how  very  few  were  the  shares  she  owned  and  how 
extremely  superﬁcial  were  the  comments  I  heard  that  day,  but  the  
interest that was kindled by that conversation has continued all during 
my life. 

With this degree of interest and in a period when most businesses 
were far less concerned with the legal hazards of dealing with minors 
than is the case today, I was able to make a few dollars for myself dur- 
ing  the  roaring  bull  market  of  the  middle  1920’s.  I  was  strongly  dis- 
couraged  from  this,  however,  by  my  physician  father,  who  felt  that  it 
would simply teach me gambling habits. This was unlikely, as I am not  
by nature inclined to take chances merely for the sake of taking chances,  
which is the nature of gambling. On the other hand, as I look back upon 
it, my tiny scale stock activities of that period taught me almost noth- 
ing of any great value so far as investment policies were concerned. 

FORMATIVE EXPERIENCES 

Before the Great Bull Market of the 1920’s was to come to its crashing 
end, I did have an experience, however, that was to teach me much of 
real importance for use in the years ahead. In the 1927–28 academic year 
I was enrolled as a ﬁrst-year student in Stanford University’s then ﬂedg-
ling Graduate School of Business. Twenty per cent of that year’s course, 
that is one day a week, was devoted to visiting some of the largest busi-
ness enterprises in the San Francisco Bay area. Professor Boris Emmett, 
who  conducted  this  activity,  had  not  been  given  this  responsibility 
because of the usual academic background. In those days, the large mail  
order companies obtained a signiﬁcant part of their merchandise through 
contracts with suppliers whose sole customer was one or the other of 
these ﬁrms. These contracts frequently were so hard on the manufactur- 
er and afforded him so little proﬁt margin that from time to time a man- 
ufacturer would ﬁnd himself in severe ﬁnancial difﬁculty. It was not in 
the interest of the mail order houses to see their vendors fail. Professor 
Emmett had for some years been the expert employed by one such mail 
order ﬁrm with the job of salvaging these faltering companies when they 
had been squeezed too tightly. As a result, he knew a great deal about 
management. One of the rules under which this course was conducted 
was that we would visit no company that would just take us through the 
plant. After “seeing the wheels go around,” the management had to be 

 
2 3 0  

willing to sit down with us so that, under the very shrewd questioning 
of our professor, we could learn something of what the strengths and 
weaknesses of the business really were. I recognized that this was a learn-
ing opportunity of just the type that I was seeking. I was able to jockey 
myself into a position to take particular advantage of it. In that day, over 
a half century ago, when the ratio of automobiles to people was tremen- 
dously lower than it is today, Professor Emmett did not have a car. I did.  
I offered to drive him to these various plants. I did not learn much from 
him on the way over. However, each week on the way back to Stanford,  
I would hear comments of what he really thought of that particular com- 
pany. This provided me with one of the most valuable learning experi-
ences I have ever been privileged to enjoy. 

Also on one of these trips I formed a speciﬁc conviction that was  
to prove of tremendous dollar value to me a few years in the future.  
It was actually to lay the foundation for my business. One week we 
visited not one but two manufacturing plants that were located next 
door to each other in San Jose. One was the John Bean Spray Pump 
Company, the world leaders in the manufacture of the type of pumps 
that  were  used  to  spray  insecticides  on  orchards  to  combat  natural 
pests. The other was the Anderson-Barngrover Manufacturing Com-
pany, also world leaders, but in the ﬁeld of equipment used by fruit 
canneries. In the 1920’s the concept of a “growth company” had not 
yet been verbalized by the ﬁnancial community. However, as I some-
what  awkwardly  worded  it  to  Professor  Emmett,  “I  thought  that  
those two companies had probabilities of growing very much beyond 
their present size to a degree that I had seen in no other company we 
had visited.” He agreed with me. 

Also, through spending part of the time on these automobile trips 
by asking Professor Emmett about his previous business experiences, I 
learned something else that was to stand me in good stead in the years 
ahead. This  was  the  extreme  importance  of  selling  in  order  to  have  a 
healthy business. A company might be an extremely efﬁcient manufac- 
turer or an inventor might have a product with breathtaking possibilities, 
but this was never enough for a healthy business. Unless that business 
contained people capable of convincing others as to the worth of their 
product, such a business would never really control its own destiny. It 
was later that I was to build on this base to conclude that even a strong 
sales arm is not enough. For a company to be a truly worthwhile invest-
ment, it must not only be able to sell its products, but also be able to 

Origins of a Philosophy 

2 3 1 

appraise changing needs and desires of its customers; in other words, to 
master all that is implied in a true concept of marketing. 

FIRST LESSONS IN THE SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE 

As  the  summer  of  1928  approached  and  my  ﬁrst  year  in  the  business 
school came to an end, an opportunity arose which seemed to me too 
good to pass up. In contrast to the hundreds of students that are enrolled 
each year in this school today, my class, being only the third in the grad-
uate school’s history, contained nineteen students. The graduating class 
one year ahead of me contained only nine. Just two of these nine were 
trained in ﬁnance. In that day of great stock market ferment, both were 
snapped up by New York-based investment trusts. At the last minute, an 
independent San Francisco bank, which years later was acquired by the 
Crocker National Bank of that city, sent down to the school a request  
for a graduate trained in investments. The school was anxious not to pass 
up this opportunity because if their representative merited the approval 
of the bank, it could be the forerunner of many opportunities for plac-
ing future graduates in the years to come. However, they had no grad-
uate to send. It was not easy to do, but when I heard of this opportunity, 
I ﬁnally persuaded the school to send me with the thought that if I were 
to  make  good,  I  would  stay  there.  If  I  could  not  ﬁll  the  job,  I  would 
come back and take second-year courses, with the bank realizing that 
the school had made no pretense of sending them a completely trained 
student. 

Security analysts in those pre-crash days were called statisticians. It 
was three successive years of sensationally falling stock prices that were  
to occur just a short time ahead that caused the work of  Wall Street’s  
statisticians  to  fall  into  such  disrepute  that  the  name  was  changed  to 
security analysts. 

I found that I was to be the statistician for the investment banking  
end of the bank. In those days, there was no legal barrier to banks being  
in  the  brokerage  or  investment  banking  business.  The  work  I  was  
assigned to do was extremely simple. In my opinion, it was also intel- 
lectually dishonest. The investment arm of the bank was chieﬂy engaged 
in selling high interest rate, new issues of bonds on which they made 
quite  sizable  commissions  as  part  of  underwriting  syndicates.  No  
attempt was made to evaluate the quality of these bonds or any stocks  

 
2 3 2  

they  sold,  but  rather  in  that  day  of  a  seller’s  market  they  gratefully  
accepted any part of a syndicate offered them by their New York asso- 
ciates  or  by  the  large  investment  banking  houses. Then  the  security  
salesmen for the bank would portray to their customers that they had a  
statistical  department  capable  of  surveying  those  customers’  holdings  
and issuing to them a report on each security handled. What was actu- 
ally done in those “security analyses” was to look up the data on a par- 
ticular  company  in  one  of  the  established  manuals  of  the  day,  such  as 
Moody’s or Standard Statistics. Then someone like myself, with no further 
knowledge than what was reported in that manual, would simply para-
phrase the wording of the manual to write his own report. Any company  
that was doing a large volume of sales was invariably reported as “well 
managed,” just because it was big. I was under no direct orders to rec- 
ommend that customers switch some of the securities I “analyzed” into 
whatever security the bank was attempting to sell at the moment, but 
the whole atmosphere was one of encouraging this type of analysis. 

BUILDING THE BASICS 

It was not very long before the superﬁciality  of  the whole procedure 
caused  me  to  feel  that  there  must  be  a  better  way  to  do  this.  I  was 
extremely  fortunate  in  having  an  immediate  boss  who  completely  
understood why I was concerned and granted me the time to make an 
experiment which I proposed to him. At that time, in the fall of 1928, 
there was a great deal of speculative interest in radio stocks. I introduced  
myself  as  a  representative  of  the  investment  arm  of  the  bank  to  the  
buyers  of  the  radio  department  of  several  retail  establishments  in  San 
Francisco. I asked them their opinions of the three major competitors 
in this industry. I was given surprisingly similar opinions from each of 
them. In particular, I learned a great deal from one man who was him-
self an engineer and who had worked for one of these companies. One 
company, Philco, which from my standpoint unfortunately was private- 
ly owned so that it represented no stock market opportunity, had devel- 
oped models which had especial market appeal. As a result, they were 
getting  market  share  at  a  beautiful  proﬁt  to  themselves  because  they 
were  highly  efﬁcient  manufacturers.  RCA  was  just  about  holding  its 
own market share, whereas another company, which was a stock market 
favorite of the day, was slipping drastically and showing signs of getting 

Origins of a Philosophy 

2 3 3 

into trouble. None of this was the direct business of the bank, for it was  
not  handling  radio  stocks.  Nevertheless,  an  evaluative  report  seemed 
likely to help me considerably within the bank because many key bank 
ofﬁcers  who  would  see  it  were  personally  involved  in  speculation  in 
these issues. Nowhere in material from Wall Street ﬁrms who were talk-
ing about these “hot” radio issues could I ﬁnd a single word about the 
troubles that were obviously developing for this speculative favorite. 

In the ensuing twelve months, as the stock market continued on its  
reckless  but  merry  way  with  most  stocks  climbing  to  new  highs,  I  
noticed  with  increasing  interest  how  the  stock  I  had  singled  out  for 
trouble was sagging further and further in that rising market. It was my 
ﬁrst  lesson  in  what  later  was  to  become  part  of  my  basic  investment 
philosophy:  reading  the  printed  ﬁnancial  records  about  a  company  is 
never enough to justify an investment. One of the major steps in pru-
dent  investment  must  be  to  ﬁnd  out  about  a  company’s  affairs  from  
those who have some direct familiarity with them. 

At this early point, however, I had not achieved the next logical step 
in this type of reasoning: It is also necessary to learn as much as possible  
about the people who are running a company under investment con- 
siderations, either by getting to know those people yourself or by ﬁnd-
ing someone in whom you have conﬁdence who knows them well. 

As 1929 started to unfold, I became more and more convinced of 
the unsoundness of the wild boom that seemed to be continuing. Stocks 
continued climbing to ever higher prices on the amazing theory that we 
were in a “new era.”  Therefore, in the future, year after year of advanc-
ing per-share earnings could be taken as a matter of course. Yet as I tried 
to appraise the outlook for America’s basic industries, I saw a number of 
them with supply-demand problems that seemed to me to indicate their 
outlook was getting rather wobbly. 

In August of 1929 I issued another special report to the ofﬁcers of 
the bank. I predicted that the next six months would see the beginning 
of the greatest bear market in a quarter of a century. It would be very 
satisfying to my ego, if at this point, I could alter drastically the tale of 
just what happened and leave the impression that, having been exactly 
right in my forecasting, I then proﬁted greatly from all this wisdom. The 
facts were quite to the contrary. 

Even  though  I  felt  strongly  that  the  whole  stock  market  was  too 
high in those dangerous days of 1929, I was nevertheless entrapped by 
the  lure  of  the  market. This  caused  me  to  look  around  to  ﬁnd  a  few 

 
2 3 4  

stocks that “were still cheap” and were worthwhile investments because 
“they had not gone up yet.”As a result of the small proﬁts from the tiny 
amount of stock transactions a few years back and the saving of a good 
part of my salary, plus some money I had earned in college, I managed 
to scrape together several thousand dollars as 1929 went along. I divid- 
ed  this  almost  equally  among  three  stocks  which,  in  my  ignorance,  I 
thought  were  still  undervalued  in  that  overpriced  market.  One  was  a 
leading locomotive company with a still quite low price-earnings ratio. 
With railroad equipment being one of the most cyclical of all industries, 
it takes very little imagination to see what was to happen to that com- 
pany’s  sales  and  proﬁts  in  the  business  depression  that  was  about  to 
engulf  us. The  other  two  were  a  local  billboard  company  and  a  local 
taxicab company, also selling at very low price-earnings ratios. In spite 
of my success in ferreting out what was going to happen to the radio 
stocks,  I  just  did  not  have  the  sense  to  start  making  similar  inquiries 
from people who knew about these two local enterprises, even though 
obtaining such information or even getting to meet the people who ran 
these businesses would have been relatively simple, since they were close 
at hand. As the depression increased, I learned rather vividly why these 
companies had been selling at such low price-earnings ratios. By 1932, 
only a tiny percentage of my original investment was represented by the 
market value of the shares in these companies. 

THE GREAT BEAR MARKET 

Fortunately for my future well-being, I have an intense dislike for los- 
ing money. I have always believed that the chief difference between a 
fool and a wise man is that the wise man learns from his mistakes, while 
the fool never does. The corollary of this is that it behooved me to go 
over my mistakes pretty carefully and not to repeat them again. 

My approach to investing expanded as I learned from my 1929 mis-
takes. I learned that, while a stock could be attractive when it had a low  
price-earnings  ratio,  a  low  price-earnings  ratio  by  itself  guaranteed  
nothing and was apt to be a warning indicator of a degree of weakness  
in the company. I began realizing that, all the then current Wall Street 
opinion to the contrary, what really counts in determining whether a 
stock is cheap or overpriced is not its ratio to the current year’s earn-
ings, but its ratio to the earnings a few years ahead. If I could build up 

Origins of a Philosophy 

2 3 5 

in myself the ability to determine within fairly broad limits what those 
earnings might be a few years from now, I would have unlocked the key 
both to avoiding losses and to making magniﬁcent proﬁts! 

In addition to learning that a low price-earnings ratio was just as apt 
to be a sign that a stock was an investment trap as that it was a bargain, 
acute  awareness  of  my  miserable  investment  performances  during  the 
Great  Bear  Market  made  me  vividly  aware  of  something  of  possibly  
even greater importance. I had been spectacularly right in my timing of  
when  the  bull  market  bubble  was  about  to  burst,  and  almost  right  in 
judging the full force of what was to happen. Yet except for a possible  
small boost in my reputation among a very small circle of people, this 
had done me no good whatsoever. From then on, I was to realize that  
all the correct reasoning about an investment policy or about the desir- 
ability or purchase or sale of any particular stock did not have the least 
bit of value until it was translated into action through the completion 
of speciﬁc transactions. 

A CHANCE TO DO MY THING 

In the spring of 1930 I made a change of employers. I only mention this 
because it triggered the events that were to cause the emergence of the 
investment  philosophy  that  has  guided  me  since  that  time. A  regional 
brokerage ﬁrm came to me and made me a salary offer which, at age 22  
and for that time and place, I found quite difﬁcult to refuse. Further- 
more, they offered me a vastly more appealing work assignment than the  
dissatisfying experience as a “statistician” in the investment banking arm 
of  the  bank. With  no  assigned  duties  whatsoever,  I  was  to  be  free  to 
devote my time to ﬁnding individual stocks which I thought were par- 
ticularly suitable candidates for either purchase or sale because of their 
characteristics. I was then to write reports on my conclusions to circu- 
late among the brokers employed by this ﬁrm to help them stimulate 
business that would be proﬁtable for their clients. 

This  offer  came  to  me  just  after  Herbert  Hoover  had  made  his 
famous “Prosperity is just around the corner” statement. Several partners  
of  the  ﬁrm  involved  implicitly  believed  this. As  a  result  of  the  1929  
crash, their total payroll had dropped from 125 employees to 75. They 
told me that if I accepted their offer, I would be number 76. I was just 
as bearish at the time as they were bullish. I felt sure the bear market was 

 
2 3 6  

a long way from over. I told them that I would come on one condition.  
While  they  were  free  to  ﬁre  me  at  any  time  if  they  did  not  like  the 
quality of my work, lack of seniority must be no inﬂuence whatsoever 
if adverse ﬁnancial markets forced them to make further reduction in 
payroll. They agreed to this provision. 

FROM DISASTER, OPPORTUNITY SPRINGS 

As employers, I could not have asked for nicer people. In the ensuing  
eight  months,  I  had  one  of  the  most  valuable  business  educational  
experiences  of  my  life.  I  saw  at  ﬁrst  hand  example  after  example  of  
how  the  investment  business  should  not  be  conducted.  As  1930  
unfolded  and  stocks  once  again  continued  on  what  seemed  like  an 
almost  endless  decline,  my  employers’  position  got  more  and  more  
precarious. Then,  just  before  Christmas  of  1930,  we,  who  had  so  far  
survived  the  economic  holocaust,  witnessed  the  grim  picture  of  the 
whole  ﬁrm  being  suspended  from  the  San  Francisco  Stock  Exchange 
for insolvency. 

This grim news for my associates was to prove one of the most for- 
tunate business developments, if not the most fortunate, of my life. For 
some time I had had vague plans that when prosperity returned I would 
start  my  own  business  by  charging  clients  a  fee  for  managing  their 
investments. I am purposely using this roundabout way to describe the 
activities of an investment counselor or an investment advisor because 
in those days neither of these terms had yet been used. However, with 
almost  everyone  in  the  ﬁnancial  business  retrenching  during  that  
gloomy January of 1931, the only security industry job I could ﬁnd was 
a purely clerical and, to me, a quite unattractive one. If I had properly 
analyzed  the  situation,  I  would  have  realized  that  this  was  exactly  the 
right time to start a new business of the kind I had in mind. I was to 
ﬁnd that there were two reasons for this. One was that, after almost two 
years of the most severe bear market this nation had ever seen, nearly 
everyone was so dissatisﬁed with their existing brokerage connections 
that they were in the mood to listen even to someone both young and 
advocating a radically different approach to the handling of their invest-
ments as was I. Also, as the economy reached its depths in 1932, many 
key businessmen had so little to do in pursuing their own affairs that 
they had the time to see someone who was calling on them. In more 

Origins of a Philosophy 

2 3 7 

normal times, I would never have gotten by their secretaries. One of the 
most worthwhile clients of my entire business career, and a man whose 
family’s investments I still handle, was a typical example of this. Some 
years afterwards he told me that on the day I called he had had almost 
nothing to do and had already ﬁnished reading the sports section of the 
newspaper. So when my name and purpose were told him by his secre-
tary, he thought, “Listening to this guy will at least occupy my time.” He  
confessed, “If  you  had  come  to  see  me  a  year  or  so  later,  you  never  
would have gotten into my ofﬁce.” 

A FOUNDATION IS FORMED 

All this was to result in several years of very hard work in a tiny ofﬁce 
with  low  overhead. With  no  windows  and  merely  glass  partitions  to 
serve as two of the walls, my total ﬂoor space was little larger than that 
needed to jam together a desk, my chair, and one other chair. For this, 
together with free local telephone service and a reasonable amount of 
secretarial help from the  secretary-receptionist of  the  gentleman  from 
whom I leased this space, I paid the princely sum of $25 per month. My  
only other expenses were stationery, postage and a very occasional long  
distance call. The account book still in my possession provides an indi- 
cation of how difﬁcult it really was to start a new business in 1932.After  
very  long  hours  of  work  over  and  above  this  overhead,  I  made  a  net 
proﬁt averaging $2.99 per month for that year. In the still difﬁcult year 
of  1933,  I  did  a  triﬂe  better,  showing  an  improvement  of  just  under  
1000 percent, an average monthly earnings of just over $29.This possi- 
bly was about what I would have made as a newsboy selling papers on 
the street. Yet in what those years were to bring me in the future, they 
were two of the most proﬁtable years of my life. They provided me with 
the foundation for an extremely proﬁtable business and with a group of 
highly loyal clients by 1935. It would be nice if I could claim that it was 
brilliant thinking on my part that caused me to start my business when  
I did rather than waiting until better times were to arrive. Actually, it was 
the unattractiveness of the only job that seemed open to me that pushed 
me into it.

Learning from Experience

While I had been working at the bank, I had noticed with con- 

siderable interest a news item about the two neighboring San 
Jose  companies  that  had  intrigued  me  so  much  during  my 
student  days  at  the  Stanford  Business  School.  In  1928  the  John  Bean 
Manufacturing  Co.  and  the  Anderson-Barngrover  Manufacturing  
Co.  had  merged  with  a  leading  vegetable  canning  manufacturer,  
Sprague  Sells  Corporation  of  Hoopeston,  Illinois,  to  form  a  brand  
new entity called the Food Machinery Corporation. 

As in other periods of rampant speculation the nation was in the throes 
of such a stock buying mania that the supply of Food Machinery Corpo- 
ration  stock  offered  for  sale  rose  in  price  in  an  attempt  to  meet  the 
demand. In that same year of 1928, at least twenty other new issues, and 
perhaps twice that many, were sold by members of the San Francisco Stock  
Exchange to eager buyers in the Bay area. The lack of soundness of some  
of these issues was little short of appalling. An ofﬁcer of one stock exchange 
ﬁrm, that sold shares in a company that was to sell bottled water from 
across the Paciﬁc, told me that these shares were sold without a complete  
set of ﬁnancial statements in the hands of the underwriters, who had little 
more than a photograph of the spring from which the water was supposed  
to come and a minor amount of personal contact with the selling share- 
holders! In the public mind, the stock of the Food Machinery Corpora- 
tion was just another of the exciting new offerings of that year, neither sig- 
niﬁcantly better nor worse than the rest. It was offered at a price of $21½. 
In  those  days,  pools  for  the  manipulation  of  shares  were  entirely 
legal. A local group with little expertise in running a pool but headed  

2 3 8

Learning from Experience 

2 3 9 

by  a  man  with  great  enthusiasm  for  Food  Machinery  Corporation 
decided to “run an operation” in the company’s shares. The methods of 
all  these  pools  were  fundamentally  similar. The  members  would  sell 
stock back and forth among themselves at gradually rising prices. All this 
activity  on  the  stock  tape  would  attract  the  attention  of  others,  who 
would then start to buy and take the pool’s shares off its hands at still 
higher  prices.  Some  highly  skilled  manipulators,  some  of  whom  had  
made many millions of dollars and one of whom, a year or so later, was 
to offer me a junior partnership, were quite experienced and able prac- 
titioners of this rather questionable art. Manipulation was not the objec-
tive  of  the  operators  of  this  Food  Machinery  pool,  however. As  the 
autumn of 1929 was to arrive and stocks were to face the precipice that  
lay ahead, the pool managed to buy for itself most of the shares that had 
been  offered  to  the  public.  Although  the  quoted  price  of  the  Food 
Machinery shares at the peak was in the high 50’s, there was very little 
stock in the hands of the public as a result. 

As  in  each  of  the  succeeding  years  the  general  level  of  business 
activities worsened relative to the year before, it was obvious what was 
to happen to the ﬂotsam and jetsam of small companies that went pub-
lic in the 1928 excitement. One after another of these companies passed 
into  bankruptcy,  with  many  of  the  remainder  reporting  losses  rather 
than proﬁts. The market for the shares of these ﬁrms largely dried up. 

There were one or two companies in this group other than Food 
Machinery that were fundamentally both sound and attractive. However,  
the general public showed no discrimination whatsoever, considering all of 
them little more than speculative junk. By the time the market was to reach  
its ﬁnal low in 1932, and again equal that low at the time of closing of the 
entire banking system of the country coincidental with the inauguration 
of Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 4, 1933, Food Machinery shares were 
down to a price of between $4 and $5, with the all-time low being 100 
shares at $3¾.

FOOD MACHINERY AS AN   
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY 

As 1931 unfolded and I cast about seeking an opportunity for my infant busi- 
ness, I looked upon Food Machinery’s situation with increasing excitement. 

 
2 4 0  

Recognizing the costliness of my not having taken the trouble to meet 
with and judge the managements of the two local companies in which 
I had lost such a large percentage of my investment a few years before,  
I determined never to make this mistake again. The more I got to know 
the  Food  Machinery  people,  the  greater  my  respect  for  them  grew. 
Because in many ways this company, as it existed in the depths of the 
Great Depression, was a microcosm of the type of opportunity I was to 
seek in the years ahead. It may be helpful to explain just what it was that 
caused me nearly a half century ago to see such a future in this partic- 
ular corporation. 

Parenthetically and unfortunately, I did not carry my policy of in- 
depth ﬁeld analysis through to its logical conclusion in the immediate 
years. I was less diligent in getting to know and to judge managements 
that were located in more distant areas. 

In the ﬁrst place, even though Food Machinery was relatively small, 
it was a world leader in size and, I believe, in quality of the product line 
in  each  of  the  three  activities  in  which  it  was  engaged. This  gave  the  
ﬁrm the advantage of scale; that is, as a large and efﬁcient manufacturer 
the ﬁrm could also be a low-cost producer. 

Next,  its  marketing  position  was,  from  a  competitive  standpoint, 
extremely strong. Its products were highly regarded by its customers. It 
controlled its own sales organization. Furthermore, its canning machin-
ery lines, with a large number of installations already in the ﬁeld, had a 
“locked  up”  market  of  some  proportions. This  consisted  of  spare  and 
replacement parts for the equipment already in the ﬁeld. 

Added to this sound base was the most exciting part of the business. 
For  a  company  of  its  size,  the  ﬁrm  enjoyed  a  superbly  creative  engi- 
neering  or  research  department. The  company  was  perfecting  equip-
ment  in  promising  new  product  areas.  Among  these  were  the  ﬁrst 
mechanical  pear  peeler  ever  to  be  offered  to  the  industry,  the  ﬁrst 
mechanical  peach  pitter,  and  a  process  for  synthetically  coloring  
oranges. Oranges from areas which produced fruit with the most juice 
was  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  because  the  product  looked  less 
attractive to the housewife than other types in which intrinsic quality 
was no better. At only one other time in my business life have I seen a 
company  which,  in  my  judgment,  had  on  the  horizon  as  big  a  dollar 
volume  of  potentially  successful  new  products  in  relation  to  the  then  
existing  size  of  business  as  was  the  case  with  the  Food  Machinery 
Corporation in the period from 1932 through 1934. 

Learning from Experience 

2 4 1 

By this time, I had learned enough to know that, no matter how 
attractive, such matters by themselves were not sufﬁcient to assure great 
success. The quality of the people involved in the company was just as  
critical. I use the word quality to encompass two quite different charac- 
teristics. One of these is business ability. Business ability can be further 
broken down into two very different types of skills. One of these is han-
dling the day-to-day tasks of business with above-average efﬁciency. In 
the day-to-day tasks, I include a hundred and one matters, varying all  
the  way  from  constantly  seeking  and  ﬁnding  better  ways  to  produce 
more  efﬁciently  to  watching  receivables  with  sufﬁcient  closeness.  In 
other words, operating skill implies above-average handling of the many 
things that have to do with the near-term operation of the business. 

However,  in  the  business  world,  top-notch  managerial  ability  also 
calls for another skill that is quite different. This is the ability to look 
ahead  and  make  long-range  plans  that  will  produce  signiﬁcant  future 
growth for the business without at the same time running ﬁnancial risks 
that may invite disaster. Many companies contain managements that are 
very good at one or the other of these skills. However, for real success, 
both are necessary. 

Business ability is only one of the two “people” traits that I believe 
is absolutely essential for a truly worthwhile investment. The other falls 
under the general term of integrity and encompasses both the honesty 
and the personal decency of those who are running a company. Anyone 
receiving his ﬁrst indoctrination into the investment world in the period 
that preceded the 1929 crash would have seen rather vivid examples of the 
extreme importance of integrity. The owners and managers of a busi- 
ness are always closer to that business’s affairs than are the stockholders. 
If the managers do not have a genuine sense of trusteeship for the stock- 
holders, sooner or later the stockholders may fail to receive a signiﬁcant 
part of what is justly due them. Managers preoccupied by their own per- 
sonal interests are not likely to develop an enthusiastic team of loyal peo-
ple around them—something that is an absolute must if a business is to 
grow to a size that one or two people can no longer control. 

As I saw the situation in those dark days of the deep depression, and 
as I see it now after all these years, this infant Food Machinery Corpo- 
ration  was  unusually  attractive  from  the “people”  standpoint.  John  D. 
Crummey, the president and son-in-law of the original founder of the 
John  Bean  Manufacturing  Co.,  was  not  only  an  extremely  efﬁcient 
operating head and highly regarded by his customers and his employees, 

 
2 4 2  

but also he was a deeply religious man who scrupulously lived up to a 
high  moral  code. The  chief  engineer  of  the  company  was  a  brilliant 
conceptual  designer. Also  of  considerable  importance,  he  was  a  man  
who  designed  along  lines  that  would  give  his  products  worthwhile 
patent  protection.  Finally,  to  round  out  the  strength  of  this  relatively 
small  organization,  John  Crummey  persuaded  his  son-in-law,  Paul  L. 
Davies,  who  was  reluctant  to  abandon  what  appeared  to  be  a  most 
promising  career  in  banking,  to  join  the  company  to  give  it  ﬁnancial 
strength and conservatism. Actually, Paul Davies at ﬁrst made this move 
so reluctantly that he only agreed to take a one-year leave of absence 
from the bank to help his family business over the ﬁrst rough year of  
merger.  During  that  year,  he  became  so  interested  in  the  exciting 
prospects that lay ahead that he decided to stay permanently with the 
company. Later, as its president, he was to lead it to a size and degree of 
prosperity that was to dwarf the pleasing accomplishments of the next 
few years. 

This then was a company that inherently had desirable characteristics 
that are only occasionally found among available investments. The people 
were outstanding. Yet, small as the company was, it was not just one man 
who was making key contributions. In relation to competitors, the com-
pany was unusually strong, it was handling its business well, and it had in 
the ofﬁng enough new product lines with potentials that were large in 
relation to the then size of the company. Even if some of these products 
did not materialize, the future should be very bright with others. 

ZIGGING AND ZAGGING

However, to all this should be added something of equal importance if 
an investment is to prove a genuine bonanza. The largest proﬁts in the 
investment ﬁeld go to those who are capable of correctly zigging when 
the ﬁnancial community is zagging. If the future of the Food Machin-
ery  Corporation  had  been  properly  appraised  at  that  time,  the  proﬁts 
that were to accrue to those who bought the shares in the 1932–1934 
period would have been very much smaller. It was only because the true 
worth of this company was not generally recognized and Food Machin-
ery  was  thought  to  be  just  another  of  the  many “ﬂaky”  companies  
which were sold to the public at the height of a speculative orgy that it 
was possible to buy these shares in quantity at the ridiculous price to 

Learning from Experience 

2 4 3 

which they had sunk. This matter of training oneself not to go with the 
crowd but to be able to zig when the crowd zags, in my opinion, is one 
of the most important fundamentals of investment success. 

I wish I had the command of English to be able to describe ade-
quately the degree of my internal, emotional and intellectual excitement 
as  I  contemplated  what  this  as  yet  ﬁnancially  unrecognized  Food 
Machinery Corporation might do for both my tiny personal ﬁnances 
and for the infant business I was attempting to get started. My timing 
seemed right. Like a spring that had been compressed too far and was 
starting to recoil, the years from 1933 to 1937 were to see stocks as a  
whole advancing slowly at ﬁrst, and then bursting into a full bloom bull 
market, followed by a sizable break in 1938 and a full recovery the fol- 
lowing year. With a deep conviction that Food Machinery would vast- 
ly outperform the market as a whole, I bought my clients every share 
that I was able to convince them to hold. I made the possibilities of this 
business the spearhead of my approach in talking to any potential clients 
I could reach. I felt that here was just the type of unique, almost once 
in a lifetime, opportunity that Shakespeare so well described when he 
said, “There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the ﬂood, leads 
on to fortune.” In those exciting years when my hopes were high and 
both my purse and reputation in the ﬁnancial community were almost 
non-existent,  I  quoted  those  exciting  words  to  myself  time  and  time 
again to stiffen my determination. 

CONTRARY, BUT CORRECT

Much has been written in the literature of investments on the impor-
tance of contrary opinion. Contrary opinion, however, is not enough. I 
have seen investment people so imbued with the need to go contrary to 
the general trend of thought that they completely overlook the corol-
lary of all this which is: when you do go contrary to the general trend 
of investment thinking, you must be very, very sure that you are right. 
For example, as it became obvious that the automobile was largely to 
displace the streetcar and the shares of the once favored urban railways 
began to sell at ever lower price-earnings ratios, it would have been a 
rather costly thing just to be contrary and buy streetcar securities only  
on the grounds that because everyone thought they were in a declining 
stage,  they  must  be  attractive.  Huge  proﬁts  are  frequently  available  to  

 
2 4 4  

those who zig when most of the ﬁnancial community is zagging, pro- 
viding they have strong indications that they are right in their zigging. 
If a quotation from Shakespeare was a vital force in formulating my 
policies  on  the  matter,  so  also,  strangely  enough,  was  a  popular  song  
from World War I. As one of the very thinning ranks of those who can 
still remember how the home front reacted in the stirring days of 1918, 
I might point out that in its excitement and enthusiasm for that war the 
American  public  had  a  naivete  then  quite  different  from  its  grimness 
about such matters in World War II, when the horrors of war were more 
clearly understood. Firsthand news of the casualties and the ﬁlth and the 
terror of those in the front lines had not yet permeated the continental 
United  States  in  1918. As  a  result,  the  popular  music  of  the  day  was  
ﬁlled with cheerful and humorous war songs in a way that happened on 
a much smaller scale in World War II, and not at all during the Vietnam 
ﬁasco.  Most  of  these  songs  came  out  in  the  form  of  sheet  music  for 
pianos. One of these songs, published with a picture of a proud mama 
looking  down  on  parading  soldiers,  had  the  title, “They’re All  Out  of 
Step But Jim.” 

I recognized from the very ﬁrst that I was running a distinct risk of 
being “out of step.” My very early purchases of Food Machinery and a 
number  of  other  companies  were  bought “out  of  phase.”  when  their 
intrinsic merit was completely unrecognized by the ﬁnancial commu- 
nity.  I  might  be  completely  wrong  in  my  thinking  and  the  ﬁnancial 
community could be right. If so, nothing would be worse for my clients 
or myself than letting my ﬁrm convictions about a particular situation 
lock up a sizable amount of funds unproﬁtably for an endless period of 
years because I zigged when the ﬁnancial community had zagged, and  
I had been wrong in doing so. 

However,  while  I  realized  thoroughly  that  if  I  were  to  make  the  
kinds  of  proﬁts  that  are  made  possible  by  the  process  that  I  have 
described as zigging when the rest zags, it was vital that I have some sort 
of quantitative check to be sure that I was right in zigging. 

PATIENCE AND PERFORMANCE

With this in mind, I established what I called my three-year rule. I have 
repeated again and again to my clients that when I purchase something 
for them, not to judge the results in a matter of a month or a year, but  

Learning from Experience 

2 4 5 

to  allow  me  a  three-year  period.  If  I  have  not  produced  worthwhile 
results for them in that time, they should ﬁre me. Whether I have been 
successful in the ﬁrst year or unsuccessful can be as much a matter of  
luck as anything else. In my management of individual stocks over all 
these  years  I  have  followed  the  same  rule,  only  once  having  made  an 
exception. If I have a deep conviction about a stock that has not per-
formed by the end of three years, I will sell it. If this same stock has per- 
formed  worse  rather  than  better  than  the  market  for  a  year  or  two,  I 
won’t like it. However, assuming that nothing has happened to change 
my original view of the company, I will continue to hold it for three 
years. 

In the second half of 1955, I bought a substantial number of shares 
in two companies in which I had never previously invested. They proved 
to be almost a classic example of the advantages and problems of invest-
ing contrary to the currently accepted view of the ﬁnancial community. 
Looking back, 1955 could be considered the beginning of a period of 
almost ﬁfteen years that might be termed the “ﬁrst Golden Age of elec-
tronic stocks.” I am using the adjective “ﬁrst” so that there can be no 
confusion in anyone’s mind with what I believe will be considered the 
Golden Age for semiconductor stocks, something which I suspect lies 
ahead of us and will be associated with the 1980’s. At any rate, in 1955 
and  immediately  thereafter,  the  ﬁnancial  community  was  about  to  be 
dazzled by a whole series of electronic companies which were to show 
gains that by 1969 had reached truly spectacular proportions. IBM, Texas  
Instruments, Varian, Litton Industries and Ampex are a few that come to 
mind.  However,  in  1955,  all  of  that  lay  ahead. At  that  time,  with  the 
exception  of  IBM,  all  these  stocks  were  considered  highly  speculative 
and  beneath  the  notice  of  conservative  investors  or  big  institutions. 
However, sensing part of what might lie ahead, I acquired what for me 
were  rather  sizable  positions  in  both Texas  Instruments  and  Motorola 
during the latter parts of 1955. 

Today  Texas  Instruments  is  the  largest  world-wide  producer  of 
semiconductors,  with  Motorola  running  a  close  second. At  that  time, 
Motorola’s position in the semiconductor industry was insigniﬁcant. It 
was no factor at all in causing me to buy the shares. Rather, I became 
impressed  both  with  the  people  and  with  Motorola’s  dominant  posi- 
tion  in  the  mobile  communications  business,  where  an  enormous 
potential seemed to lie; whereas the ﬁnancial community was valuing  
it as just another television and radio producer. Motorola’s subsequent  

 
2 4 6  

rise  in  the  semiconductor  area,  resulting  at  least  in  part  from  their 
acquiring  the  services  of  Dr.  Daniel  Noble,  was  all  to  come  later  and 
was additional icing on the cake not anticipated by me at the time of 
purchase. In the case of Texas Instruments, aside from an equally great 
liking and respect for the people, I was inﬂuenced by a quite different  
set  of  beliefs.  I  saw,  as  did  others,  a  tremendous  future  that  could  be  
built  out  of  their  transistor  business  as  the  complexities  of  semicon- 
ductors were yielding to human ingenuity. I felt that those were peo- 
ple who could compete on at least even terms, and probably better than 
even terms, with General Electric, RCA, Westinghouse, and other giant 
companies  despite  the  opinion  of  much  of Wall  Street. A  number  of 
people criticized me for risking funds in a small “speculative company” 
which they felt was bound to suffer from the competition of the cor- 
porate giants. 

After buying these shares, the near-term results in the stock market 
were quite different. Within a year, Texas Instruments had increased in 
value quite handsomely. Motorola ﬂuctuated in a range from 5 percent  
to  10  percent  below  my  cost  of  purchase.  It  performed  sufﬁciently 
poorly that one of my major clients became so irritated by its market 
action that he refused to call Motorola by name. He only referred to it  
as  “that  turkey  which  you  bought  me.” These  unsatisfactory  quota- 
tions were to continue for moderately over a year. Yet as awareness of  
the  investment  signiﬁcance  of  the  communications  arm  of  Motorola 
was to seep into the consciousness of the ﬁnancial community, togeth- 
er  with  the  ﬁrst  signs  of  a  turnabout  in  the  semiconductor  area,  the  
stock then became a rather spectacular performer. 

While I was buying Motorola, I was doing so in conjunction with  
a  large  insurance  company  that  had  let  the  Motorola  management 
know that they were also interested in the conclusions of my ﬁrst visit. 
Shortly  after  the  insurance  company  too  had  bought  a  signiﬁcant 
amount  of  Motorola  stock,  they  submitted  their  entire  portfolio  to  a 
New York bank for appraisal. With the exception of Motorola, the bank 
divided their portfolio into three groups: most attractive, less attractive, 
and  least  attractive. They  refused  to  place  Motorola  in  any  category, 
however, saying this was not the type of company on which they spent 
time; therefore they had no opinion about it. Yet one of the ofﬁcials of 
the insurance company told me over three years later that in the face  
of  this  rather  negative Wall  Street  view,  Motorola  had  by  that  time 
outperformed every other stock in their portfolio! If I had not had my  

Learning from Experience 

2 4 7 

“three-year  rule,”  I  might  have  been  less  ﬁrm  in  holding  my  own 
Motorola intact through a period of poor market action and of some 
client criticism. 

TO EVERY RULE, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS… 
BUT NOT MANY

Have  I  ever  sold  stock  because  of  this  three-year  rule  and  then  later 
wished I had not made this sale because of a subsequent major rise in  
the stock? Actually, there have only been a relatively small number of 
times  when  I  have  made  a  sale  triggered  by  this  three-year  rule  and 
nothing else. This is not because there have been so few times that pur-
chases made by me have failed to provide the major rise which was my  
purpose  in  initiating  them.  In  the  majority  of  such  cases,  further  
insights  about  the  company  opened  up  as  I  continued  to  investigate 
additional  aspects  of  the  situation,  and  these  insights  caused  me  to  
change my views about it. However, in those relatively few cases where 
it was the three-year rule and only that which caused me to sell, I can-
not recall a single case where subsequent market action caused me to 
wish I had held on to the shares. 

Have  I  ever  violated  my  own  three-year  rule? The  answer  is  yes, 
exactly  once,  and  this  was  many  years  later,  toward  the  middle  of  the 
1970’s.  Three  years  before,  I  had  acquired  a  moderately  substantial  
block  of  shares  in  the  Rogers  Corporation.  Rogers  had  expertise  in 
certain  areas  of  polymer  chemistry,  and  I  believed  they  were  on  the  
way  to  developing  various  semiproprietary  families  of  products  
which  would  show  quite  dramatic  increase  in  sales  and  not  just  for  a 
year or two, but for many years. Yet, at the end of three years the stock 
was  down,  and  so  were  the  earnings  of  the  company.  Several  inﬂu- 
ences  were  at  work,  however,  which  made  me  feel  this  was  one  time  
to  ignore  my  own  standards  and  to  make  this  “the  exception  that  
proves the rule.” One of these inﬂuences was my strong feeling about 
Norman Greenman, the company’s president. I was convinced he had  
unusual  ability,  the  determination  to  see  these  matters  through,  as  
well  as  something  else  which  I  consider  of  great  value  to  an  intelli- 
gent  investor:  the  kind  of  honesty  that  caused  him  not  to  conceal  
repeated bad news that could not fail but be embarrassing for him to 
tell.  He  saw  to  it  that  those  interested  in  his  company  understood  all 

 
2 4 8  

the  unfavorable  aspects  of  what  was  happening,  as  well  as  the  favor- 
able potentials. 

There was another element which inﬂuenced me greatly: a major 
reason the company’s proﬁts were so poor was that Rogers was spend-
ing a quite disproportionate amount of money on a single new product 
development seeming to offer prospects of great results. This was divert-
ing both money and people from other potentially exciting new prod-
ucts which were getting less corporate effort. New products of this type 
do have magniﬁcent potential. When the painful decision was made to 
abandon  all  the  effort  on  this  one  particular  product,  it  was  not  long 
before it became quite apparent that several other innovations of great 
promise  were  starting  to  ﬂower. All  this,  however,  took  time.  In  the 
meanwhile,  the  company’s  failure  to  live  up  to  the  hopes  of  many  of 
those who had bought the shares caused the stock to drop to levels that 
were absurd in relation to its sales, its assets, or any type of normal earn-
ing power. Here seemed a classic example of zigging when the ﬁnancial 
community was zagging. Therefore, three-year rule or no, I sizably fur-
ther increased my holdings and those of my clients, even though a few 
of those clients, inﬂuenced by the years of waiting and the negative per- 
formance, looked at this with a degree of apprehension. As so often hap- 
pens  in  situations  of  this  sort,  when  the  turn  came,  it  came  fast. As  it 
became apparent that the betterment of earnings was not a one- or two-
year matter, but gave strong indications of being but the basis for years  
of genuine growth, the stock continued to rise proportionately. 

AN EXPERIMENT WITH MARKET TIMING 

All this, however, gets me years ahead of my story, because back in the 
1930’s  there  were  other  things  I  also  had  to  learn  through  trial  and  
error  as  my  investment  philosophy  was  gradually  taking  shape.  In  my 
casting  around  for  ways  to  make  money  through  common  stocks,  I 
began  realizing  that  I  might  have  a  worthwhile  by-product  from  my 
study  of  the  Food  Machinery  Corporation.  Enough  of  their  business  
was dependent on the fruit and vegetable canning industry so that in 
order  to  be  reasonably  sure  I  was  right  about  my  Food  Machinery  
purchases,  I  had  inadvertently  learned  a  good  deal  about  what  inﬂu-
enced  the  fortunes  of  the  fruit  and  vegetable  canning  companies  
themselves. This industry was highly cyclical because of both ﬂuctuating 

Editor: 
perhaps 
substitute 
"Great"?

Learning from Experience 

2 4 9 

general  business  conditions  and  erratic  weather  inﬂuences  as  they 
affected speciﬁc crops. 

As long as I was becoming somewhat familiar with the characteris- 
tics of the packing industry anyway, I decided I might as well try and 
take advantage of this knowledge, not through long-term investments,  
as I was doing with Food Machinery, but through in and out transac-
tions in the shares of the California Packing Corporation, then an inde- 
pendent company and the largest fruit and vegetable canner. Three dif- 
ferent times, from the depths of the Big Depression to the end of that 
decade,  I  bought  shares  of  this  company.  Each  time,  I  sold  them  at  a 
proﬁt. 

Superﬁcially,  this  might  sound  like  I  was  doing  something  quite 
worthwhile.  Nevertheless  when,  for  reasons  I  will  explain  shortly,  I  
endeavored a few years later to analyze the wise and unwise moves I made 
in my business, it became increasingly apparent to me how silly these 
activities were. They took a great deal of time and effort that could well 
have  been  devoted  to  other  things. Yet  the  total  rewards  in  dollars  in 
relation to the sums at risk were insigniﬁcant in comparison to the prof-
its I had made for my people in Food Machinery and in other situations 
where I had bought for long-range gains and held over a considerable 
period of years. Furthermore, I had seen enough of in and out trading, 
including  some  done  by  extremely  brilliant  people,  that  I  knew  that 
being successful three times in a row only made it that much more like- 
ly that the fourth time I would end in disaster. The risks were consider- 
ably more than those involved in purchasing equal amounts of shares in 
companies  I  considered  promising  enough  to  want  to  hold  them  for 
many years of growth. Therefore, at the end of World War II, by which 
time much of my present investment philosophy was largely formulat- 
ed, I had made what I believe was one of the more valuable decisions  
of my business life. This was to conﬁne all efforts solely to making major 
gains over the long run. 

REACHING FOR PRICE, FOREGOING OPPORTUNITY 

During the 1930’s I learned, or at least partially learned, something else 
which I consider truly important. I have already mentioned my complete 
failure to beneﬁt from my correct forecasts of the Great Bear Market 
which started in 1929. All the correct reasoning in the world is of no 

 
2 5 0  

beneﬁt in stock investment unless it is turned into speciﬁc action. My 
ﬁrst  experience  in  operating  my  own  business  occurred  during  the  
depth  of  the  Great  Depression,  when  very  small  amounts  of  money 
became  of  abnormal  signiﬁcance.  Possibly  because  of  this,  or  possibly 
because of my personal characteristics, as I started my business I found 
myself constantly battling for “eighths and quarters.” Brokers who knew 
much more than I did kept telling me if I believed that a stock would 
rise in a few years to several times its current price, it really made very 
little difference whether I acquired its shares at $10 or $10¼. Yet I con- 
tinually placed limit orders with no better reason for a limit than a purely 
arbitrary decision on my part that I would pay, say, $101⁄8 and no more. 
Logically,  this  is  ridiculous.  I  have  observed  it  to  be  a  bad  investment 
habit  that  is  deeply  ingrained  in  many  people  besides  myself,  but  not 
ingrained at all in others. 

The potential dangers of arbitrary limits were made clear to me as 
the result of a mistake of someone else. I remember as though it were 
yesterday running into one of my more important clients by chance on 
the sidewalk in front of a San Francisco bank. I told him that I had just 
come back from visiting the Food Machinery Corporation, the outlook 
was never so exciting, and that I thought he should buy some addition- 
al shares. He completely agreed with me and asked where the stock had 
closed that particular afternoon. I told him $34½. He gave me a signif-
icant order and said he would pay $33¾ but no more. Over the next  
day or two the stock ﬂuctuated in a range just fractionally above his bid. 
It  never  got  down  to  it.  I  phoned  him  twice,  urging  him  to  go  up  a 
quarter of a point so that I could buy stock. Unfortunately he replied, 
“No,  that  is  my  price.” Within  a  few  weeks  the  stock  had  risen  over 
50  percent  and,  after  allowing  for  stock  split-ups,  never  again  in  the 
company’s  history  was  it  to  come  down  to  anywhere  near  where  he 
could have bought it. 

This gentleman’s actions made an impression on me that my own 
stupidity had not. Gradually, I was to overcome much of this weakness  
of mine. I am thoroughly aware that if a buyer desires to acquire a very 
large  block  of  stock,  he  cannot  completely  ignore  this  matter  of  an 
eighth or a quarter, because by buying a very few shares he can signiﬁ-
cantly put the price up on himself for the balance. However, for the great 
majority of transactions, being stubborn about a tiny fractional difference 
in the price can prove extremely costly. In my own case, I have com-
pletely conquered it in regard to buying, but only partially in regard to 

Learning from Experience 

2 5 1 

selling. Within the past year, my placing a small sell order with a limit 
rather than at the market caused me to miss a transaction by exactly a 
quarter of a point, with the result that, as I write this, the shares are now 
down 35 percent from where I placed my order. At levels only halfway 
between that limit order and current prices, I sold only part of this not 
very large holding.

The Philosophy Matures

Our entry into World War II was not entirely without some signiﬁ-

cance in the development of my investment philosophy. Early in 
1942 I found myself in an unaccustomed role as a ground ofﬁcer 
doing various business related jobs for the Army Air Corps. For three and 
a half years, I simply “beached” my business as I performed my not very 
valuable  services  on  behalf  of  Uncle  Sam.  In  recent  years,  I  have  fre-
quently said that I did quite a job for my country. Neither Hitler nor 
Emperor Hirohito ever succeeded in getting a man into the territories I 
defended. These were Arkansas, Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska! At any rate, 
during this time of various desk type jobs wearing Uncle Sam’s uniform, 
I found that almost without warning I would alternate between two dif- 
ferent types of periods. For a while, I would have so much to do that the 
last thing I would be able to think about was my peacetime business. At 
other times, I would sit at my desk with very little to do. When things 
were slow, I found it less unpleasant to analyze in great detail just how I 
would build up my business when the happy day that I would no longer 
be wearing a uniform might arise than it was to think of the personal  
living and Army type problems with which, from a short-range point of 
view, I was confronted. It was during such periods that my present invest- 
ment philosophy took steadily more deﬁnite shape. It was then I decid- 
ed there was not enough future in the type of in and out trading that I 
have described in the stock of California Packing. 

During this period, I reached two other conclusions that were to be 
of some signiﬁcance to my future business. Before the war I had served 
all  types  of  clients,  large  and  small,  with  varying  types  of  objectives.  

2 5 2

The Philosophy Matures 

2 5 3 

Most, but not all, of my business had been focused on ﬁnding unusual 
companies that would enjoy signiﬁcant, above-average growth in future 
years. After the war, I would limit my clientele to a small group of large 
investors with the objective of concentrating solely on this single class  
of growth investment. For tax reasons, growth was more likely to ben-
eﬁt these clients. 

My other major conclusion was that the chemical industry would 
enjoy a period of major growth in the postwar years. Therefore, a high 
priority project on returning to civilian life was to endeavor to ﬁnd the 
most attractive of the larger chemical companies and make this a major 
holding for the funds I was handling. I by no means spent 100 percent  
of my time doing this, but in the ﬁrst year after restarting my business  
I did spend a rather considerable amount of time in talking to anyone I 
could ﬁnd who had real knowledge of this complex industry. Such peo-
ple as distributors who handled the lines of one or more large compa- 
nies, professors in the chemical departments of the universities who had 
intimate  knowledge  of  chemical  business  people,  and  even  some  of  
those in the major construction companies that had put up plants for 
various  of  the  chemical  producers  all  proved  extremely  worthwhile 
sources  of  background  information.  By  combining  these  inputs  with 
analyses of the usual ﬁnancial data, it only took about three months to  
narrow the choices down to one of three companies. From there on, the 
going  was  slower  and  the  decisions  more  difﬁcult.  However,  by  the 
spring of 1947 I decided that the Dow Chemical Company would be 
my choice. 

E PLURIBUS UNUM 

There  were  many  reasons  for  the  choice  of  Dow  Chemical  from  the 
many  promising  chemical  ﬁrms.  I  believe  it  might  be  worthwhile  to 
enumerate some of them because they are clear examples of the type of 
things  I  seek  in  the  relatively  small  number  of  companies  in  which  I 
desire to place funds. As I began to know various people in the Dow 
organization, I found that the growth that had already occurred was in 
turn creating a very real sense of excitement at many levels of manage- 
ment. The  belief  that  even  greater  growth  lay  ahead  permeated  the 
organization. One of my favorite questions in talking to any top busi-
ness  executive  for  the  ﬁrst  time  is  what  he  considers  to  be  the  most 

 
2 5 4  

important long-range problem facing his company. When I asked this  
of the president of Dow, I was tremendously impressed with his answer:  “It 
is to resist the strong pressures to become a more military-like organization 
as we grow very much larger, and to maintain the informal relationship 
whereby people at quite different levels and in various departments con-
tinue to communicate with each other in a completely unstructured way 
and, at the same time, not create administrative chaos.” 

I  found  myself  in  complete  agreement  with  certain  other  basic 
company policies. Dow limited its involvement to those chemical prod-
uct lines where it either was or had a reasonable chance of becoming 
the most efﬁcient producer in the ﬁeld as the result of greater volume, 
better chemical engineering and deeper understanding of the product 
or for some other reason. Dow was deeply aware of the need for cre-
ative research not just to be in front, but also to stay in front. There was 
also a strong appreciation of the “people factor” at Dow. There was in 
particular a sense of need to identify people of unusual ability early, to 
indoctrinate them into policies and procedures unique to Dow, and to 
make real efforts to see if seemingly bright people were not doing well 
at one job, they be given a reasonable chance to try something else that 
might be more suitable to their characteristics. 

I  found  that  although  Dow’s  founder,  Dr.  Herbert  Dow,  had  died 
some seventeen years before, his beliefs were held in such respect that 
one or another of his sayings was frequently quoted to me. While his 
comments  were  directed  primarily  at  matters  within  Dow,  I  decided  
that at least two of them were equally appropriate to my own business,  
in that they could be applied at least as well as to optimizing the selec-
tion of investments as to matters internal to the Dow Chemical Com-
pany.  One  of  these  was “Never  promote  someone  who  hasn’t  made 
some bad mistakes, because if you do, you are promoting someone who 
has never done anything.”The failure to understand this element by so 
many in the investment community has time and again created unusu- 
al investment opportunities in the stock market. 

The truly worthwhile accomplishment in the business world near- 
ly always requires a considerable degree of pioneering, in which inge- 
nuity has to be seasoned with practicality.  This is particularly true when 
the  gains  are  sought  through  leading  edge  technological  research.  No 
matter how able the people are and no matter how good may be most 
of their ideas, there are times when such efforts are bound to fail, and  
fail  dismally. When  this  happens  and  the  current  year’s  earnings  drop 

The Philosophy Matures 

2 5 5 

sharply below previous estimates as the costs of the failure are added up, 
time and again the investment community’s immediate consensus is to 
downgrade the quality of the management. As a result, the immediate 
year’s lower earnings produce a lower than the historic price earnings 
ratio to magnify the effect of reduced earnings. The shares often reach 
truly  bargain  prices. Yet  if  this  is  the  same  management  that  in  other 
years has been so successful, the chances are the same ratio of average 
success to average failure will continue on in the future. For this reason,  
the  shares  of  companies  run  by  abnormally  capable  people  can  be 
tremendous  bargains  at  the  time  one  particular  bad  mistake  comes  to  
light.  In  contrast,  the  company  that  doesn’t  pioneer,  doesn’t  take  
chances, and merely goes along with the crowd is liable to prove a rather 
mediocre investment in this highly competitive age. 

The other of Dr. Dow’s comments which I have tried to apply to  
the process of investment selection is “If you can’t do a thing better than  
others are doing it, don’t do it at all.” In this day of heavy-handed gov- 
ernment  intervention  in  so  many  types  of  business  activities,  of  high 
taxes and labor unions, and of rapid shifts in public taste from one prod-
uct to another, it seems to me that the risk of common stock ownership 
is  seldom  warranted  unless  it  is  conﬁned  to  companies  with  enough 
competitive spirit constantly to be trying and frequently succeeding in 
doing things in a manner superior to industry in general. In no other 
way are proﬁt margins usually broad enough to meet the demands of 
growth. This is, of course, particularly true during periods when inﬂa-
tion is having a signiﬁcant effect in eating away at reported proﬁts. 

HISTORY VERSUS OPPORTUNITY 

There were some remarkable parallels between the period when I was 
starting my business at the depths of the Great Depression and during 
the years 1947 through the very early 1950’s, when I was restarting it  
after a military service interlude of three and a half years. Both periods 
were times when it was unusually hard to obtain immediate results for 
clients in the face of overwhelming general pessimism. Both were times 
that  were  to  prove  spectacularly  rewarding  for  those  who  had  the 
patience. In the earlier period, stocks were driven to perhaps the lowest 
level  in  relation  to  real  value  seen  in  the Twentieth  Century,  not  just 
because of the economic havoc wrought by the Great Depression, but 

 
2 5 6  

also because prices were discounting the worry of many investors as to 
whether the American system of private enterprise would itself survive. 
It survived, and in the ensuing years the rewards of those able and willing 
to invest in the right stocks were fabulous. 

Just a few years after World War II, another fear kept stocks at levels 
almost as low in relation to intrinsic value as those seen at the depths of 
the Great Depression. This time, business was good and corporate earn-
ings  were  steadily  rising.  Nevertheless,  almost  the  entire  investment 
community were mesmerized by a simple comparison. A relatively few 
years after the Civil War, a period of immediate prosperity was followed 
by the Panic of 1873, and almost six years of deep depression. A some-
what similar period of prosperity after World War I was followed by the 
Crash of 1929 and the even deeper depression of about the same length. 
In World War II, the costs of war had run on a per diem basis about ten 
times that of World War I. “Therefore.” reasoned the dominant invest-
ment view of this period, “current excellent earnings don’t mean any-
thing.” They  will  be  followed  by  a  horrendous  crash  and  a  period  of 
extreme adversity when all would suffer. 

Year after year went by, and the per-share earnings of more corpo- 
rations rose. Along about 1949, this period became known as the era in 
which “American business is worth more dead than alive.” because as 
soon as word spread that a publicly owned company was about to go 
out of business, its shares would rise dramatically. The liquidating value 
of many a company was so much more than its current market valua-
tion. Year followed year, and slowly it began dawning on the investment 
public that perhaps stocks were being held back because of a myth. The 
expected business decline never did arrive and, excepting for two rela-
tively minor recessions in the 1950’s, the stage was being set for the great 
rewards to long-term investors that were to follow. 

As I write these words in the closing weeks before the decade of the 
80’s is about to start, it amazes me that more attention has not been paid 
to restudying the few years of stock market history that started in the 
second  half  of  1946  to  see  whether  true  parallels  may  actually  exist 
between that period and the present. Now, for the third time in my life-
time,  many  stocks  are  again  at  prices  which,  by  historic  standards,  are 
spectacularly low. In relation to reported book value, they may not be 
quite as cheap as they were in the post-World War II period. However, if  
that reported book value is adjusted for replacement value in real dollars, 
they may perhaps be cheaper than in either of the two prior, bargain 

The Philosophy Matures 

2 5 7 

value periods. The question arises: are the worries that are holding back 
stock values in the present period, such matters as the high cost of ener- 
gy or the dangers from the political left or of overextended credit, with 
the inevitable resulting drain on the level of business activity as liquidi- 
ty is restored, more serious and more apt to stop the future growth in 
this country than the fears that held back stock prices in these two prior 
periods?  If  not,  once  the  problems  of  overextended  credit  have  been 
solved, it might be logical to assume that the 1980’s and period beyond 
may offer the same sort of rewarding opportunities that characterized 
the two former periods of abnormally low prices. 

LESSONS FROM THE VINTAGE YEARS 

From a business standpoint, the ﬁfteen years from 1954 through 1969 
were a magniﬁcent time for me, as most of the relatively few stocks I was 
holding  advanced  signiﬁcantly  more  than  did  the  market  as  a  whole. 
Even so, I managed to make some bad mistakes. Successes came from 
diligent application of the approaches I have already spelled out. It is the 
mistakes that are more noteworthy. Each brought its own new lesson. 

Good  fortune  can  breed  laxness. The  mistake  which  now  embar-
rassed me the most, although it was not the most costly, arose from the 
careless application of a sound principle. 

In the early 1960’s, I had technological investments that were prov-
ing quite pleasing in the electronic, chemical, metallurgical, and machin-
ery industries. I did not have a comparable investment in the promising 
drug ﬁeld, and started seeking one. Along the way, I talked to a medical 
specialist who was preeminent in his ﬁeld. At the time, he was tremen-
dously  excited  about  a  new  drug  family  about  to  be  introduced  by  a 
small  Midwestern  manufacturer. These  drugs  he  felt  could  have  quite 
favorable impact on the future earnings of this ﬁrm relative to others in 
this ﬁeld. The potential market seemed very, very exciting. 

I then talked to just one of the ofﬁcers of this company and to only 
a few other investment people, all of whom were equally excited about 
the  potentials  of  this  new  drug.  Unfortunately,  I  did  not  pursue  my 
standard checks either with other drug companies or with other experts 
knowledgeable in this particular specialty to see if they might have con-
trary evidence to offer. Regretfully, I subsequently learned, none of the 
proponents had made a thorough investigation either. 

 
2 5 8  

The stock was selling at a price well above its worth before consid- 
ering the beneﬁts of this new family of drugs, but at a price which could 
have been but a minor fraction of potential value if the new drugs were 
all their supporters imagined. I bought the shares only to see them drop,  
at  ﬁrst  a  mere  20  percent  and  then  over  50  percent.  Ultimately  the  
whole  company  was  sold  for  cash  at  this  low  price  to  a  large  non- 
pharmaceutical corporation seeking to enter the drug ﬁeld. Even at this 
price,  now somewhat  less  than half  of  what I  had paid  for  the shares,  
I subsequently learned that the acquiring company lost money on the 
deal. Not only did this new family of drugs fail to measure up to the 
extensive hopes that had been enthusiastically projected by my friend, 
the medical specialist, but also on painful “post-mortem” reexamination 
of the situation, I found that there were management problems in this 
small drug manufacturer. With a more thorough investigation both fail-
ings would, I believe, have become apparent to me. 

From that embarrassing time forward, I have tried to be particular- 
ly thorough in making investigations in periods when things were going 
well. The only reason this particular investment folly wasn’t more cost- 
ly stemmed from my caution. Since I had had only a slight contact with 
the management, I made only a small initial investment, planning to buy 
more as I got to know the company better. Their troubles overtook me 
before I had a chance to compound my original folly. 

As the long bull market was reaching its ﬁnal peak in 1969 another 
mistake occurred. To understand what happened it is necessary to recre- 
ate the psychological fever which gripped most investors in technolog- 
ical and scientiﬁc stocks at that time. Shares of these companies, partic- 
ularly many of the smaller ones, had enjoyed advances far greater than 
the market as a whole. During 1968 and 1969 only one’s imagination 
seemed to cap the dreams of imminent success for many of these com-
panies. Some of these situations did have genuine potential, of course. 
Discrimination was at a low ebb. For example, any company serving the 
computer  industry  in  any  way  promised  a  future,  many  believed,  that 
was  almost  limitless. This  contagion  spread  into  instrument  and  other 
scientiﬁc companies as well. 

Up to this time, I resisted the temptation to go into any of the sim-
ilar companies that had just “gone public” at very high prices in the pre- 
vious year or two. Yet, being in frequent contact with those who were 
sponsoring these excitement inducing companies, I kept looking for a 
few that might be genuinely attractive. In 1969 I did ﬁnd an equipment 

The Philosophy Matures 

2 5 9 

company working in an extremely interesting new frontier of technology; 
one that had a real basis for its existence. The ﬁrm was run by a brilliant 
and honest president. I can remember still, after a long luncheon session 
with this man, my pacing up and down the airport awaiting my airplane 
home  and  trying  to  determine  whether  I  should  buy  this  company’s  
shares at the prevailing market. After considerable deliberation, I decid- 
ed to go ahead. 

I was right in diagnosing the potential of this company for it did 
grow in the years that followed. Nevertheless, it was a poor investment. 
My mistake lay in the price I paid to participate in the promise. Some 
years  later,  after  the  company  had  shown  rather  respectable  growth,  I 
sold  these  shares,  but  at  a  price  very  little  different  from  my  original  
cost. While I believe I was right in selling when I thought the company 
had  reached  a  point  where  its  future  growth  was  considerably  more 
uncertain, nevertheless selling an investment at a meager proﬁt after it  
has been held for a number of years is not the way to make capital grow  
or even protect it against inﬂation. In this case, disappointing perform- 
ance was the result of being seduced by the excitement of the times into 
paying an unrealistic initiation price. 

DO FEW THINGS WELL 

A policy judgment that was wrong for me engendered quite a different 
kind of mistake, and one which did cost a signiﬁcant amount of dollars.  
My mistake was to project my skill beyond the limits of experience. I  
began  investing  outside  the  industries  which  I  believe  I  thoroughly 
understood, in completely different spheres of activity; situations where 
I did not have comparable background knowledge. 

When  it  comes  to  manufacturing  companies  that  serve  industrial 
markets  or  to  companies  on  the  leading  edge  of  technology  that  are 
serving manufacturers, I believe that I know what to look for—where 
both  the  strong  points  and  pitfalls  may  lie.  However,  different  skills  
proved important in evaluating companies making and selling consumer- 
type products. When the products of competitive companies are essen-
tially rather similar to one another, and when changes in market share 
depend largely on shifting public tastes or on fashions greatly inﬂuenced 
by  the  effectiveness  of  advertising,  I  learned  that  the  abilities  which  I  
had in selecting outstanding technological companies did not extrapolate 

 
2 6 0  

to the point where I could identify what produces unusual success in 
real estate operations. 

Others  may  do  well  in  quite  diverse  investment  arenas.  Perhaps, 
unlike  the  other  types  of  mistakes  I  have  made  during  my  business 
career, this one should properly be ignored by others. Nevertheless, an 
analyst must learn the limits of his or her competence and tend well the 
sheep at hand. 

STAY OR SELL IN ANTICIPATION OF POSSIBLE   
MARKET DOWNTURNS? 

Should  an  investor  sell  a  good  stock  in  the  face  of  a  potentially  bad 
market? On this subject, I fear I hold a minority view given the invest-
ment psychology prevalent today. Now more than ever, the actions of 
those who control the vast bulk of equity investments in this country 
appear to reﬂect the belief that when an investor has achieved a good 
proﬁt in a stock and fears the stock might well go down, he should grab 
his proﬁt and get out. My view is rather different. Even if the stock of 
a particular company seems at or near a temporary peak and that a siz- 
able decline may strike in the near future, I will not sell the ﬁrm’s shares 
provided  I  believe  that  its  longer  term  future  is  sufﬁciently  attractive. 
When I estimate that the price of these shares will rise to a peak quite 
considerably higher than the current levels in a few years time, I prefer 
to hold. My belief stems from some rather fundamental considerations 
about  the  nature  of  the  investment  process.  Companies  with  truly 
unusual prospects for appreciation are quite hard to ﬁnd for there are 
not  too  many  of  them.  However,  for  someone  who  understands  and 
applies sound fundamentals, I believe that a truly outstanding company 
can be differentiated from a run-of-the-mill company with perhaps 90 
percent precision. 

It is vastly more difﬁcult to forecast what a particular stock is going 
to do in the next six months. Estimates of short-term performance start 
with economic estimates of the coming level of general business. Yet the 
forecasting record of seers predicting changes in the business cycle has 
generally been abysmal. They can seriously misjudge if and when reces- 
sions may occur, and are worse in predicting their severity and duration. 
Furthermore, neither the stock market as a whole nor the course of any 

The Philosophy Matures 

2 6 1 

particular stock tends to move in close parallel with the business climate. 
Changes in mass psychology and in how the ﬁnancial community as a 
whole decided to appraise the outlook either for business in general or 
for  a  particular  stock  can  have  overriding  importance  and  can  vary 
almost  unpredictably.  For  these  reasons,  I  believe  that  it  is  hard  to  be 
correct  in  forecasting  the  short-term  movement  of  stocks  more  than  
60 percent of the time no matter how diligently the skill is cultivated. 
This may well be too optimistic an estimate. On the face of it, it doesn’t 
make good sense to step out of a position where you have a 90 percent 
probability  of  being  right  because  of  an  inﬂuence  about  which  you 
might at best have a 60 percent chance of being right. 

Moreover, for those seeking major gains through long-term invest-
ments,  the  odds  of  winning  are  not  the  only  consideration.  If  the 
investment is in a well-run company with sufﬁcient ﬁnancial strength, 
even  the  greatest  bear  market  will  not  erase  the  value  of  holding.  In 
contrast,  time  after  time,  truly  unusual  stocks  have  subsequent  peaks 
many hundreds of percent above their previous peaks. Thus, risk/reward 
considerations favor long-term investment. 

So, putting it in the simplest mathematical terms, both the odds and 
the  risk/reward  considerations  favor  holding. There  is  a  much  greater 
chance of being wrong in estimating adverse short-term changes for a 
good stock than in projecting its strong, long-term price appreciation 
potential. If you stay with the right stocks through even a major tem- 
porary  market  drop,  you  are  at  most  going  to  be  temporarily  behind  
40  percent  of  the  former  peak  at  the  very  worst  point  and  will  ulti-
mately  be  ahead;  whereas  if  you  sell  and  don’t  buy  back  you  will  have  
missed long-term proﬁts many times the short-term gains from having 
sold the stock in anticipation at a short-term reversal. It has been my 
observation that it is so difﬁcult to time correctly the near-term price 
movements  of  an  attractive  stock  that  the  proﬁts  made  in  the  few 
instances  when  this  stock  is  sold  and  subsequently  replaced  at  signiﬁ-
cantly lower prices are dwarfed by the proﬁts lost when timing is wrong. 
Many have sold too soon and have either never gotten back in or have 
postponed reinvestment too long to recapture the proﬁts possible. 

The example I will use to illustrate this point is the weakest one I 
have experienced. In 1962, two of the major electronics investments I 
had  made  had  risen  to  heights  that  made  the  outlook  for  near-term 
price movement extremely dangerous. Texas Instruments was selling at 
over ﬁfteen times the price I had paid for it seven years before. Another 

 
2 6 2  

company which I bought a year or so later, and which I shall call by the 
ﬁctitious name of “Central California Electronics.” had enjoyed a simi-
lar  percentage  rise.  Prices  had  gone  too  far.  I  consequently  informed 
each of my clients that the prices of these two stocks were unrealistical- 
ly high and discouraged them from using these prices in measuring their 
current  net  worth. This  is  a  practice  I  have  rarely  followed,  and  then  
only when I had an unusually strong conviction that the next important 
move for one or more of my stocks would be sharply downward. Nev- 
ertheless, in the face of this conviction, I urged my clients to maintain 
their holdings, in the belief that some years ahead both stocks would rise 
to  very  much  higher  levels. When  the  correction  in  values  came  for 
these  two  stocks,  it  proved  even  more  severe  than  I  had  anticipated.  
Texas Instruments at its subsequent bottom sold off 80 percent from its 
1962  peak.  Central  California  Electronics  did  not  perform  quite  so  
badly, but still sold off by almost 60 percent. My beliefs were being tested 
in the extreme! 

However, within a few years Texas Instruments was once again selling 
at new high levels more than double its 1962 high. Patience had paid off 
here. Central California Electronics’ performance was not a happy one.  
As  the  general  stock  market  started  to  recover,  problems  within  the 
management  of  Central  California  Electronics  became  apparent.  
Changes in personnel occurred. I became quite worried and made what 
I believe was a thorough investigation. I reached two conclusions and 
neither one pleased me. One was that I had misjudged the former man- 
agement. I should have been more aware of its deﬁciencies, yet wasn’t. 
Neither could I be sufﬁciently enthusiastic about the new management 
to  warrant  continuing  to  hold  the  shares.  I  consequently  sold  these 
holdings in the following twelve-month period at a price only slightly 
better than half of the 1962 peak. Even so, my clients, depending on the 
applicable purchase price, gained from seven to ten times the original 
cost. 

As I have already indicated, I am deliberately citing a weak example 
rather than a dramatic one to illustrate why I believe it pays to ignore 
near-term ﬂuctuations in situations that hold real promise. My error in 
the Central California Electronics instance was not in holding the shares 
through  a  temporary  decline,  but  in  something  far  more  important.  I 
had grown too complacent as a result of the enormous success of my 
investments in this company. I began paying too much attention to what 
I was hearing from top management and not doing sufﬁcient checking 

The Philosophy Matures 

2 6 3 

with people at lower levels and with customers. When I recognized the  
situation and acted upon it, I was then able to make the same kind of  
gains  I  had  expected  to  make  in  Central  California  Electronics  by 
switching these funds to other electronic companies, chieﬂy Motorola, 
which  fortunately  rose  in  the  next  few  years  to  a  value  several  times 
higher than the prior peak of Central California Electronics. 

IN AND OUT MAY BE OUT OF THE MONEY 

There is more to learn from the Texas Instruments and Central Califor- 
nia Electronics situations. When I originally acquired these Texas Instru- 
ments shares in the summer of 1955, they were bought for the longest 
type of long-range investment. It seemed to me the company fully war-
ranted this degree of conﬁdence. About a year later, the stock had dou-
bled. With one exception, the various owners of the funds I managed, 
familiar as they were with my method of operations, showed no more 
interest in taking a proﬁt than did I. However, at that time I had one rel-
atively new account owned by people who, in their own business, were 
used  to  building  up  inventory  when  markets  were  low  and  cutting  it  
back  sharply  when  they  were  high.  Now  that Texas  Instruments  had 
doubled, they brought strong pressure to sell, which for a time I was able 
to resist. When the stock rose an additional 25 percent to give them a  
proﬁt  of  125  percent  of  their  cost,  the  pressure  to  sell  became  even 
stronger. They explained, “We agree with you. We like the company, but 
we can always buy it back at a better price on a decline.” I ﬁnally com- 
promised with them by persuading them to keep part of their holding 
and sell the rest. Yet when the big drop occurred several years later and 
the  shares  fell  80  percent  from  their  peak,  this  new  bottom  was  still 
almost 40 percent higher than the price at which this particular holder 
was so eager to sell! 

After a very sharp advance, a stock nearly always looks too high to the  
ﬁnancially untrained. This client demonstrated another risk to those who 
follow the practice of selling shares that still have unusual growth prospects 
simply because they have realized a good gain and the stock appears tem- 
porarily  overpriced. These  investors  seldom  buy  back  at  higher  prices 
when they are wrong and lose further gains of dramatic proportions. 

At the risk of being repetitious, let me underscore my belief that the 
short-term price movements are so inherently tricky to predict that I do 

 
2 6 4  

not believe it possible to play the in and out game and still make the 
enormous proﬁts that have accrued again and again to the truly long-
term holder of the right stocks. 

THE LONG SHADOW OF DIVIDENDS

In these comments I have tried to show how, as the years have passed, 
various experiences gradually helped to shape my investment philoso- 
phy. However, looking back, I ﬁnd no speciﬁc event, either a mistake or 
a  favorable  opportunity,  which  caused  me  to  reach  the  conclusions  I 
have on the matter of dividends. Many observations over a long period 
of years gradually crystallized my views. I started out taking for granted 
the belief, as widely accepted forty years ago as it is today, that dividends 
were  something  highly  favorable  to  the  stockholder  and  something 
which should be welcomed enthusiastically. Then I began seeing com- 
panies that had so many exciting looking new ideas ﬂowing from their 
research  departments  that  they  could  not  capitalize  upon  them  all.  
Resources  were  too  scarce  or  too  expensive.  I  began  thinking  how  
much better it might be for some stockholders if, instead of paying div-
idends, more of the company’s resources were retained and invested in 
more of these innovative products. 

I began increasingly to recognize that the interests of all stockhold- 
ers were not identical. Some investors needed dividend income to sup-
port their lifestyle. These stockholders would undoubtedly prefer cur-
rent  dividends  to  greater  future  proﬁts  and  increased  value  for  their  
shares  resulting  from  increased  investment  in  promising  products  and 
technologies. These  investors  could  ﬁnd  investments  in  ﬁrms  whose 
needs  and  opportunities  for  productive  use  of  capital  were  not  too 
demanding. 

But  how  about  the  stockholder  whose  earning  power  or  other 
income sources exceeded needs and who was regularly saving money 
anyway? Would it not be better for this investor if the company passed 
up its dividends, which would often be subject to a fairly high income 
tax rate, and instead reinvested the funds, tax-free, in future growth? 

Shortly after World War II, when I started concentrating my invest-
ment  activities  almost  solely  on  the  attainment  of  major,  long-range 
capital appreciation, another aspect of the dividend payout issue became 
even more apparent. The companies with the greatest growth prospects 

The Philosophy Matures 

2 6 5 

were under tremendous pressure to pay no dividends at all. Their need 
for funds and their ability to use funds productively was too large. The 
cost of developing these new products was just the ﬁrst heavy drain on 
capital needed to ﬁnance growth. There followed the heavy marketing 
expense needed to introduce them to the customer. With success, plant 
expansion was needed to service a growing volume. Once the new line 
was on its way, there were further capital requirements for the increased 
inventories and accounts receivable which, in most cases, grow almost  
in direct proportion to the volume of the business. 

There  seemed  a  natural  ﬁt  of  interest  between  those  ﬁrms  with 
bountiful investment opportunities and certain investors who sought to  
make  the  greatest  possible  proﬁt  in  relation  to  the  risk  involved  and  
who neither needed additional income nor wanted to pay unnecessary 
taxes.  Such  investors  should,  I  believe,  mainly  conﬁne  investments  to 
non-dividend-paying  companies  with  strong  earning  power  and  with 
attractive  places  to  reinvest  their  earnings.  These  were  the  clients  I  
sought to serve. 

Recently, however, the situation has become less clear-cut. Institu- 
tional holders have become an increasingly dominant force in day-to-
day  stock  transactions.  Institutions  such  as  pension  and  proﬁt  sharing 
funds pay no income tax on their dividends. Many of them as a matter 
of policy will not invest in a company unless it pays some dividend, no 
matter how small. Attracting and holding these buyers have caused many 
companies with unusual prospects to initiate modest dividend payments 
of  rather  small  percentage  total  annual  earnings.  Managers  of  some 
would-be  growth  companies  have  concurrently  reduced  their  payout 
dramatically. Today,  the  skill  in  investing  retained  earnings  wisely  has 
become a more critical factor in separating the unusual company from 
the pack. 

For these reasons, I have come to believe that the most that can be 
said on this subject of dividends is that it is an inﬂuence that should be 
downgraded  very  sharply  by  those  who  do  not  need  the  income.  In 
general, more attractive opportunities will be found among stocks with 
a low dividend payout or none at all. However, so general is the feeling 
among  those  who  determine  dividend  policies  that  paying  out  divi-
dends is beneﬁcial to the investor (as it is for some) that occasionally I 
have found truly attractive opportunities among higher dividend payout 
companies, although this has not happened very often.

Is the Market Efﬁcient?

By the coming of the 1970’s nearly all of my investment philosophy 

was  ﬁrmly  in  place,  molded  by  my  experience  of  four  prior  
decades. It is not coincidence that with only one exception all of 
both the wise and the foolish actions I have mentioned as examples that 
helped  form  the  background  of  this  philosophy  were  incidents  that 
occurred  during  these  four  prior  decades. This  does  not  mean  that  I  
have  made  no  mistakes  in  the  1970’s.  Unfortunately,  it  seems  that  no 
matter how much I try, sometimes I must stub my toe more than once  
in the same way before I truly learn. However, in the examples I have 
used  I  usually  took  the  ﬁrst  instance  when  a  particular  type  of  event 
happens to illustrate my point, which explains why all but one of the 
examples I used occurred during these earlier periods. 

It might be helpful to notice the striking parallels in each of these 
past ten-year periods. With the possible exception of the 1960’s, there 
has  not  been  a  single  decade  in  which  there  was  not  some  period  of 
time  when  the  prevailing  view  was  that  external  inﬂuences  were  so  
great and so much beyond the control of individual corporate manage- 
ments that even the wisest common stock investments were foolhardy 
and perhaps not for the prudent. In the 1930’s there were years when  
this view, inﬂuenced by the Great Depression, was at its most extreme, 
but  perhaps  not  any  more  than  the  fear  of  what  the  German  war  
machine and World War II might do in the 1940’s, or the certainty that 
another major depression would hit in the 1950’s, or fear of inﬂation, 
hostile  government  actions,  etc.,  in  the  1970’s. Yet  every  one  of  these 
periods created investment opportunities that seemed almost incredible 

2 6 6

Is the Market Efﬁcient? 

2 6 7 

with all the advantages of hindsight. In each of these ﬁve decades there 
were not a few, but many common stock opportunities that ten years 
later yielded proﬁts running to many hundreds of percent for those who 
had bought and stayed with the shares. In some instances proﬁts ran well 
into the thousands of percent. Again in every one of these ﬁve decades 
some stocks which were the speculative darlings of the moment were to 
prove the most dangerous kind of trap for those who blindly followed 
the crowd rather than those who really knew what they were doing. All 
of  these  ten-year  periods  essentially  resembled  the  others  in  that  the 
greatest opportunities came from ﬁnding situations that were extreme- 
ly  attractive  but  that  were  undervalued  because  at  that  particular 
moment the ﬁnancial community had signiﬁcantly misjudged the situ-
ation. As I look back on the various forces that buffeted the securities 
market over this ﬁfty-year period and at the great waves of public opti-
mism and pessimism that succeeded each other over this time span, the 
old French proverb, “Plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose” (the more 
things change, the more they remain the same), comes to mind. I have  
not  the  slightest  doubt  that  as  we  enter  the  emerging  decade  of  
the 1980’s, with all the problems and the prospects that it now offers,  
the same will continue to hold true. 

THE FALLACY O F   THE EFFICIENT MARKET

In the last few years, too much attention has been paid to a concept that 
I believe is quite fallacious. I refer to the notion that the market is per-
fectly efﬁcient. Like other false beliefs in other periods, a contrary view 
may open up opportunities for the discerning. 

For  those  unfamiliar  with “efﬁcient”  market  theory,  the  adjective 
“efﬁcient”  does  not  refer  to  the  obvious  mechanical  efﬁciency  of  the 
market.  A potential buyer or seller can get his order to the market where 
a transaction can be executed very effectively within a matter of a cou-
ple of minutes. Neither does “efﬁciency”refer to the delicate adjustment 
mechanism which causes stock prices to move up or down by fractions 
of a point in response to modest changes in the relative pressure of buy- 
ers and sellers. Rather, this concept holds that at any one time the mar-
ket “efﬁcient” prices are assumed to reﬂect fully and realistically all that 
is  known  about  the  company.  Unless  someone  has  some  signiﬁcant, 
illicit inside information, there is no way genuine bargains can be found, 

 
2 6 8  

since the favorable inﬂuences that make a potential buyer believe that  
an attractive situation exists are already reﬂected in the price of stock! 

If the market was as efﬁcient as it has become fashionable to believe, 
and if important opportunities to buy or signiﬁcant reasons to sell were 
not  constantly  occurring,  stock  returns  should  not  subsequently  have  
the  huge  variations  that  they  do.  By  variation,  I  am  not  referring  to 
changes in prices for the market as a whole, but rather the dispersion of 
relative price changes of one stock against another. If the market is efﬁ-
cient in prospect, then the nexus of analysis that leads to this efﬁciency 
must be collectively poor. 

Efﬁcient market theory grew out of the academic School of Random 
Walkers. These people found that it was difﬁcult to identify technical trad- 
ing strategies that worked well enough after transactions costs to provide 
an attractive proﬁt relative to the risks taken. I don’t disagree with this. As 
you have seen, I believe that it is very, very tough to make money with in 
and out trading based on short-term market forecasts. Perhaps the market 
is efﬁcient in this narrow sense of the word. 

Most  of  us  are  or  should  be  investors,  not  traders. We  should  be 
seeking investment opportunities with unusual prospects over the long 
run and avoiding investment opportunities with poorer prospects. This 
has always been the central tenet of my approach to investments in any 
case. I do not believe that prices are efﬁcient for the diligent, knowl- 
edgeable, long-term investor. 

Directly applicable to this is an experience I had in 1961. In the fall 
of that year, as in the spring of 1963, I undertook the stimulating duty 
of substituting for the regular ﬁnance professor in teaching the senior 
course of investments at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Busi-
ness. The concept of the “efﬁcient” market was not to see the light of  
day for many years to come and had nothing to do with my motivation 
in the exercise I am about to describe. Rather, I wanted to show these  
students in a way they would never forget that the ﬂuctuations of the  
market  as  a  whole  were  insigniﬁcant  compared  to  the  differences 
between the changes in price of some stocks in relation to others. 

I divided the class into two groups. The ﬁrst group took the alpha- 
betical list of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, starting with the 
letter A; the second group, those starting with the letter T. Every stock 
was included in alphabetical order (except preferreds and utilities, which 
I consider to be a different breed of cats). Each student was assigned four 
stocks.  Each  student  looked  up  the  closing  price  as  of  the  last  day  of 

Is the Market Efﬁcient? 

2 6 9 

business  of  1956,  adjusted  the  stock  dividends  and  stock  splits  (rights 
were ignored as not having sufﬁcient impact to be worthy of the addi-
tional calculations), and compared this price with the price as of Friday, 
October 13th (if nothing else, a colorful closing date!). The percentage 
increase  or  decrease  that  occurred  in  each  stock  over  this  period  of 
almost ﬁve years was noted. The Dow Jones averages rose from 499 to 
703, or by 41 percent in this period. Altogether, there were 140 stocks  
in this sample. The results are displayed in the following table: 

Percentage Capital

200% to 1020% gain 
100% to   199% gain

These  data  are  quite  insightful.  In  a  period  when  the  Dow  Jones 
averages rose 41 percent, 38 stocks, or 27 percent of the total, showed a 
capital loss. Six of them, or 4 percent of the total, recorded a loss of over 
50 percent of their total value. In contrast, roughly one quarter of the 
stocks realized capital gains that would have been considered spectacular. 
To drive the point home, I noted that if a person invested $10,000 
in equal amounts in the ﬁve best stocks on this list, at the outset of this 
four  and  three-quarter  year  period,  his  capital  would  now  be  worth  
$70,260. On the other hand, if he had invested the $10,000 in the ﬁve 
worst  stocks,  his  capital  would  have  shrunk  to  $3,180. These  extreme 
results were most unlikely. It would take luck, either good or bad, as well 
as skill, to hit either of these extremes. It would not be so implausible  
for a person with real investment judgment to have picked ﬁve out of  
the  ten  best  stocks  for  his  $10,000  investment,  in  which  case  his  net  
worth  on  Friday  the  13th  would  have  been  $52,070.  Similarly,  some 
investors consistently select stocks for the wrong reasons and manage to 
pick lemons. For them selecting ﬁve out of the ten poorest in performance 

 
2 7 0  

is also not an entirely unrealistic expectation of results. In that case, the 
$10,000 investment would have shrunk to $4,270. On the basis of this 
comparison,  there  might  be,  in  less  than  ﬁve  years,  a  difference  of  
$48,000 between a wise and an unwise investment program. 

A year and a half later, when I also taught this same course, I repeat- 
ed the exact same exercise, with the exception that instead of using the  
letters A  and T,  I  selected  two  different  letters  in  the  alphabet  from  
which to form the sample of stocks. Again, over a ﬁve-year time frame, 
but with a different starting and a different closing date, the degree of 
variation was almost exactly the same. 

Looking back on most markets of ﬁve-year duration, I believe that 
one can ﬁnd stock performance results that are about as disparate. Some 
of this dispersion may come as the result of surprises—important new 
information about a stock’s prospects that could not be reasonably fore-
seen at the outset of the period. Most of the differences, however, can 
be anticipated at least roughly both in terms of  direction  and general 
magnitude of gains and losses relative to the market. 

THE RAYCHEM CORPORATION

In view of this kind of evidence, it is hard for me to see how anyone can 
consider the stock market efﬁcient, again using the word “efﬁcient” as it is 
used by the proponents of this theory. But to belabor the point further, let 
me take a stock market situation of just a very few years ago. In the early 
years of the 1970’s, the shares of the Raychem Corporation had consider- 
able prestige in the market place and were accordingly selling at a relative- 
ly high price-earnings ratio. Some of the reasons warranting this prestige 
may be perceived by some comments made by the company’s Executive 
Vice President, Robert M. Halperin. In outlining what he called the four 
cardinal points to Raychem’s operating philosophy, he stated: 

1.   Raychem  will  not  do  anything  technically  simple  (i.  e.,  some-
thing that would be easy for potential competitors to copy). 
2.   Raychem won’t do anything unless it can be vertically integrat- 
ed; that is, Raychem must conceive the product, manufacture it, 
and sell it to the customer. 

3.   Raychem won’t do anything unless there is a substantial oppor- 
tunity  for  real  proprietary  protection,  which  generally  means 

Is the Market Efﬁcient? 

2 7 1 

patent protection. Unless this occurs, research and development 
energies will not be employed on a project, even though other- 
wise it might ﬁt into Raychem’s skills. 

4.   Raychem will only go into new products when it believes it can 
become the market leader in whatever niche, sometimes smaller, 
sometimes larger, that product attempts to capture. 

By the mid-1970’s, awareness of these unusual strengths was sufﬁ-
ciently prevalent among those who controlled large institutional funds 
so that sizable blocks of shares had been taken out of the market by peo- 
ple who believed that Raychem was a situation of unusual competitive 
strength and attractiveness. However, it was another aspect of this com-
pany  that  gave  Raychem  its  greatest  appeal  to  these  holders  and  was 
probably the cause of the high price-earnings ratio at which it was then 
selling. Many considered that Raychem, which was spending an above 
average percentage of sales on new project development, had perfected 
a  research  organization  capable  of  producing  an  important  enough 
stream of new products so that the company could be depended on to 
show an uninterrupted upward trend in sales and proﬁts. These research 
products had quite justiﬁably a special appeal to the ﬁnancial commu- 
nity  because  many  of  the  newer  ones  only  indirectly  competed  with 
older products of other companies. Primarily, the new products enabled 
high-priced labor to do the same job in considerably less time than had 
previously been required. There were enough savings offered to the ulti-
mate customer of these products to justify a price which should afford 
Raychem a pleasing proﬁt margin. All this caused the stock toward the 
end of 1975 to reach a high of over $42½ (price adjusted for subsequent  
stock  splits)—a  level  about  25  times  the  estimated  earnings  for  the  
ﬁscal year ending June 30, 1976. 

RAYCHEM, DASHED EXPECTATIONS,   
AND THE CRASH 

Toward the close of the June 30, 1976, ﬁscal year, Raychem was hit by 
two  hammer  blows,  which  were  to  play  havoc  with  the  price  of  the 
stock  and  with  the  company’s  reputation  in  the  ﬁnancial  community. 
The ﬁnancial community had become very excited about a proprietary  

 
2 7 2  

polymer,  Stilan,  which  enjoyed  unique  advantages  over  other  com-
pounds used by the airplane industry for coating wire and which was 
then in the ﬁnal research stages. Furthermore, the polymer was to be the 
ﬁrst product in which Raychem would go basic, that is, make the orig-
inal chemicals in its own plant rather than buying raw materials from 
others and compounding them. Because of the appeal of the product, 
Raychem  had  allocated  by  a  considerable  margin  more  funds  to  this 
research product than to any other in its history.  The ﬁnancial commu- 
nity assumed this product was already on its way to success, and after  
passing  through  the  usual  “learning  curve”  experienced  by  all  new  
products it would become highly proﬁtable. 

Actually,  quite  the  opposite  was  occurring.  In  the  words  of  the 
Raychem management, Stilan was “a scientiﬁc success but a commer- 
cial failure.” Improved products of an able competitor, while technical- 
ly not as desirable as Stilan, proved adequate for the job and were far 
cheaper. Raychem management recognized this. In the course of a rel-
atively few weeks, management reached the painful decision to abandon 
the product and write off the heavy investments made in it. The result-
ing charge to earnings for that ﬁscal year was some $9.3 million. This 
charge-off caused earnings, exclusive of some offsetting special gains, to 
drop to $.08 a share from $7.95 the previous ﬁscal year. 

The ﬁnancial community was as much upset by the erosion of the 
great conﬁdence in the company’s research ability as by the precipitous 
drop  in  earnings.  Largely  ignored  was  the  basic  rule  that  some  new 
product developments are bound to fail in all companies. This is inher-
ent in all industrial research activity and in a well-run company is far 
more than offset in the long run by other successful new products. It 
may have been just bad luck that the particular project on which the 
most money had been spent had been the one to fail. At any rate, the 
effect on the stock price was dramatic. By the fourth quarter of 1976, 
the stock had dropped to a low of approximately $14¾ (again adjusted 
for subsequent splits amounting to six to one) or to approximately one-
third its former high. Of course, only a tiny amount of stock could be 
bought or sold at the low point for the year. Of greater impact, the stock 
was available at prices only moderately above this low level for months 
thereafter. 

Another  development  also  affected  the  proﬁts  of  the  company  at 
this moment and contributed to Raychem’s fall from favor. One of the 
most difﬁcult tasks for those responsible for the success of any growing 

Is the Market Efﬁcient? 

2 7 3 

company  is  to  change  the  management  structure  appropriately  as  the 
company grows to allow for the difference between what is needed for 
proper control of small companies and optimum control of big compa- 
nies. Until the end of the 1976 ﬁscal year, Raychem management had 
been set up along divisional lines based largely on manufacturing tech-
niques; that is, on the basis of the products produced. This worked well 
when the company was smaller, but was not conducive to serving the 
customer  most  efﬁciently  as  the  company  was  growing. Therefore,  at 
about the end of the 1975 ﬁscal year, top Raychem management started 
working on a “big company” management concept. The ﬁrm restruc-
tured the divisions by the industry served rather than by the physical and 
chemical composition of the products being manufactured. The target 
date to make the change was set at the end of the 1976 ﬁscal year. This 
was  done  at  a  time  when  there  was  not  the  least  thought  within  the 
management that this date would coincide with the time of the huge 
write-off for the abandonment of Stilan. 

Everyone in Raychem knew that when the organizational change 
was to occur there would be at least one quarter and probably a mini- 
mum  of  two  of  substantially  reduced  earnings. While  making  these 
changes  caused  almost  no  change  in  the  individuals  on  the  Raychem 
management payroll, so many people now had different superiors, dif- 
ferent subordinates, and different co-workers with whom they had to 
interface their activities that a time of inefﬁciency and adjustment was 
bound to occur until Raychem employees learned how best to coordi- 
nate their work with the new faces with whom they were now dealing. 
Perhaps no stronger indication could have existed to justify long-range 
conﬁdence  in  this  company  or  to  indicate  that  management  was  not 
concerned  with  short-term  results  than  its  decision  to  go  ahead  with 
this project as planned rather than to postpone what was bound to be a 
second blow to Raychem’s current earnings. 

Actually, this signiﬁcant change worked with considerably less difﬁ-
culty than had been anticipated. As expected, the ﬁrst-quarter earnings of 
the new ﬁscal year were much lower than would have been the case if the 
change had not been made. However, the change was working so well 
that as the second quarter progressed, the short-term costs of what had 
been done had largely been eliminated. Fundamentally these develop- 
ments should have been considered bullish by analysts. Raychem was now 
in a position to handle growth properly in a way that could not have been 
done before. It had successfully hurdled a barrier of the type that is most 

 
2 7 4  

apt to dull the luster of otherwise attractive growth companies. By and 
large, the ﬁnancial community did not seem to recognize this, however, 
and  instead  the  temporary  further  shrinkage  of  earnings  was  just  one 
more factor holding the stock at the low levels to which it had fallen. 

Making these price levels even more attractive to potential investors 
was  another  inﬂuence  that  I  have  seen  happen  in  other  companies 
shortly  after  they  had  abandoned  a  major  research  project  that  had  
proved unsuccessful. One ﬁnancial effect of the abandonment of Stilan 
was that a sizable amount of money that had heretofore been devoted  
to  that  project  was  now  free  to  be  allocated  elsewhere.  Even  more 
important,  it  had  similarly  freed  the  time  of  key  research  people  for 
other endeavors. Within a year or two much like a ﬁeld of ﬂowers start-
ing to bloom when rain follows drought, the company began to enjoy 
what  was  possibly  a  greater  number  of  attractive  research  projects  in 
relation to its size than had ever before been experienced. 

RAYCHEM AND THE EFFICIENT MARKET 

Now what has Raychem’s situation to do with this theory of an “efﬁ-
cient  market”  that  has  recently  gained  such  a  following  in  certain 
ﬁnancial  quarters? According  to  that  theory,  stocks  automatically  and 
instantly  adjust  to  whatever  is  known  about  a  company,  so  that  only 
those who might possess illicit “inside information” that is not known 
to  others  could  beneﬁt  from  what  might  lie  ahead  for  a  particular  
stock. In this instance, at the drop of a hat, the Raychem management 
would and did explain to anyone interested all the facts I have just cited 
and  explained  how  temporary  they  believed  was  the  period  of  poor 
earnings. 

Actually,  well  after  all  this  had  happened  and  when  proﬁts  were 
climbing to a new all-time high level, the Raychem management went 
even further. On January 26, 1978, they held a long one-day meeting 
at their headquarters which I had the privilege of attending. Raychem 
management  invited  to  this  meeting  the  representatives  of  all  institu- 
tions,  brokerage  houses,  and  investment  advisors  who  either  had  any 
interest  in  Raychem  or  they  thought  might  have.  At  this  meeting  
the  ten  most  senior  executives  of  Raychem  explained  with  what  I  
believe was extreme frankness and in detail, such as I have only occa- 
sionally seen at similar meetings of other companies, the prospects, the 

Is the Market Efﬁcient? 

2 7 5 

problems, and the current status of Raychem matters under their juris-
diction. 

In  the  year  or  two  following  this  meeting,  Raychem’s  earnings 
growth developed exactly as might have been inferred from what was 
said there. During that period, the stock was to much more than dou- 
ble from the price of $23¼ at which it was selling that day. Yet in the 
weeks  immediately  following  this  meeting,  there  was  no  particular 
effect on the stock whatsoever. Some of those present were obviously 
impressed by the picture being presented. Too many, however, were still 
under the inﬂuence of the double shock that they had experienced a 
year or two before. They obviously mistrusted what was being told them 
then. So much for the theory of an efﬁcient market. 

What kind of conclusion does the investor or the investment pro- 
fessional  reach  from  experiences  like  Raychem?  By  and  large,  those 
who have accepted and been inﬂuenced by this theory of the “efﬁcient 
market” fall into two groups. One is students, who have had a minimum 
of practical experience. The other, strangely enough, seems to be many 
managers of large institutional funds. The individual private investor, by 
and large, has paid relatively little attention to this theory. 

From this experience gained in applying my personal investment phi- 
losophy, I would conclude that in my ﬁeld of technological stocks, as the 
decade of the 1970’s comes to an end, there would therefore be more 
attractive  opportunities  among  the  larger  companies,  the  market  for 
which is dominated by the institutions, than among the small technolog- 
ical companies where the individual private investor plays a considerably 
bigger role. Just as some ten years earlier those who recognized the folly 
of the then prevailing concept of the two-tier market beneﬁted from rec- 
ognizing that particular nonsense for what it was, so in each decade false 
ideas arise creating opportunities for those with investment discernment. 

CONCLUSION

This then is my investment philosophy as it has emerged over a half cen-
tury of business experience. Perhaps the heart of it may be summarized 
in the following eight points: 

1.   Buy  into  companies  that  have  disciplined  plans  for  achieving 
dramatic  long-range  growth  in  proﬁts  and  that  have  inherent 

 
2 7 6  

qualities  making  it  difﬁcult  for  newcomers  to  share  in  that  
growth. There are so many details, both favorable and unfavor- 
able,  that  should  also  be  considered  in  selecting  one  of  these 
companies that it is obviously impossible in a monograph of this 
length  to  cover  them  adequately.  For  those  interested,  I  have 
attempted to summarize this subject as concisely as I could in the 
ﬁrst  three  chapters  of  Conservative  Investors  Sleep Well.* A  brief 
outline appears in the Appendix. 

2.   Focus  on  buying  these  companies  when  they  are  out  of  favor;  
that  is,  when,  either  because  of  general  market  conditions  or 
because the ﬁnancial community at the moment has misconcep- 
tions of its true worth, the stock is selling at prices well under 
what it will be when its true merit is better understood. 

3.   Hold  the  stock  until  either  (a)  there  has  been  a  fundamental 
change  in  its  nature  (such  as  a  weakening  of  management 
through changed personnel), or (b) it has grown to a point where 
it no longer will be growing faster than the economy as a whole. 
Only in the most exceptional circumstances, if ever, sell because 
of forecasts as to what the economy or the stock market is going 
to do, because these changes are too difﬁcult to predict. Never 
sell  the  most  attractive  stocks  you  own  for  short-term  reasons. 
However,  as  companies  grow,  remember  that  many  companies 
that are quite efﬁciently run when they are small fail to change 
management style to meet the different requirements of skill big 
companies need. When management fails to grow as companies 
grow, shares should be sold. 

4.   For those primarily seeking major appreciation of their capital, 
de-emphasize the importance of dividends. The most attractive 
opportunities are most likely to occur in the proﬁtable, but low 
or no dividend payout groups. Unusual opportunities are much 
less  likely  to  be  found  in  situations  where  high  percentage  of 
proﬁts is paid to stockholders. 

5.   Making some mistakes is as much an inherent cost of investing for 
major gains as making some bad loans is inevitable in even the 
best run and most proﬁtable lending institution. The important 
thing is to recognize them as soon as possible, to understand their 
causes, and to learn how to keep from repeating the mistakes.

Willingness to take small losses in some stocks and to let proﬁts 
grow bigger and bigger in the more promising stocks is a sign of  
good  investment  management.  Taking  small  proﬁts  in  good 
investments and letting losses grow in bad ones is a sign of abom- 
inable investment judgment. A proﬁt should never be taken just 
for the satisfaction of taking it. 

6.   There are a relatively small number of truly outstanding compa- 
nies. Their shares frequently can’t be bought at attractive prices. 
Therefore, when favorable prices exist, full advantage should be 
taken of the situation. Funds should be concentrated in the most 
desirable opportunities. For those involved in venture capital and  
quite  small  companies,  say  with  annual  sales  of  under  
$25,000,000,  more  diversiﬁcation  may  be  necessary.  For  larger 
companies, proper diversiﬁcation requires investing in a variety  
of  industries  with  different  economic  characteristics.  For  indi- 
viduals  (in  possible  contrast  to  institutions  and  certain  types  of 
funds),  any  holding  of  over  twenty  different  stocks  is  a  sign  of 
ﬁnancial incompetence. Ten or twelve is usually a better number. 
Sometimes  the  costs  of  the  capital  gains  tax  may  justify  taking 
several  years  to  complete  a  move  toward  concentration. As  an 
individual’s  holdings  climb  toward  as  many  as  twenty  stocks,  it 
nearly  always  is  desirable  to  switch  from  the  least  attractive  of 
these stocks to more of the attractive. It should be remembered 
that ERISA stands for Emasculated Results: Insufﬁcient Sophis- 
ticated Action. 

7.   A basic ingredient of outstanding common stock management is 
the ability neither to accept blindly whatever may be the domi-
nant opinion in the ﬁnancial community at the moment nor to 
reject the prevailing view just to be contrary for the sake of being 
contrary. Rather, it is to have more knowledge and to apply bet-
ter judgment, in thorough evaluation of speciﬁc situations, and 
the  moral  courage  to  act “in  opposition  to  the  crowd”  when  
your judgment tells you you are right. 

8.   In  handling  common  stocks,  as  in  most  other  ﬁelds  of  human 
activity, success greatly depends on a combination of hard work, 
intelligence, and honesty. 

Some of us may be born with a greater or lesser degree of each of 
these  traits  than  others.  However,  I  believe  all  of  us  can “grow”  our 

 
2 7 8  

capabilities  in  each  of  these  areas  if  we  discipline  ourselves  and  make  
the effort. 

While good fortune will always play some part in managing com-
mon stock portfolios, luck tends to even out. Sustained success requires 
skill and consistent application of sound principles. Within the frame-
work of my eight guidelines, I believe that the future will largely belong 
to those who, through self-discipline, make the effort to achieve it. 

Appendix

Key Factors in Evaluating Promising Firms*

My philosophy calls for making a relatively small number of invest-

ments but only in unusually promising companies. Obviously, I am 
looking for signs of growth potential in the companies I study. As impor-
tant, I am trying, through my analysis, to avoid risk. I want to make sure 
that  the  ﬁrm’s  management  has  the  wherewithal  to  capitalize  on  the 
potential and to minimize my investment risks in the process. Summa- 
rized below are some of the defensive characteristics that I search for in 
the companies that are to meet my standards of unusual promise when I 
undertake  ﬁnancial  analysis,  interviews  with  management,  and  discus- 
sions with informed people associated with the industry. 

FUNCTIONAL FACTORS 

  1.   The ﬁrm must be one of the lowest-cost producers of its products or 

services relative to its competition, and must promise to remain so. 
a.   A comparatively low breakeven will enable this ﬁrm to sur-
vive depressed market conditions and to strengthen its market

2 7 9

 
2 8 0  

and pricing position when weaker competitors are driven out 
of the market. 

b.   A higher than average proﬁt margin enables the ﬁrm to gen- 
erate more funds internally to sustain growth without as 
much dilution caused by equity sales or strain caused by ov- 
erdependence on ﬁxed-income ﬁnancing. 

  2.   A ﬁrm must have a strong enough customer orientation to rec- 
ognize changes in customer needs and interests and then to react 
promptly to those changes in an appropriate manner. This capa- 
bility should lead to generating a ﬂow of new products that more 
than offset lines maturing or becoming obsolete. 

  3.   Effective  marketing  requires  not  only  understanding  of  what   
customers want, but also explaining to them (through advertising, 
selling or other means) in terms the customer will understand. 
Close control and constant monitoring of the cost/effectiveness 
of market efforts are required. 

  4.   Even nontechnical ﬁrms today require a strong and well-directed 
research capability to (a) produce newer and better products, and 
(b) perform services in a more effective or efﬁcient way. 

  5.   There are wide differences in the effectiveness of research. Two 
important elements of more productive research are (a) market/ 
proﬁt consciousness, and (b) the ability to pool necessary talent 
into an effective working team. 

  6.   A firm with a strong financial team has several important 

advantages: 
a.  G ood  cost  information  enables  management  to  direct  its 
energies  toward  those  products  with  the  highest  potential 
for proﬁt contribution. 

b.   The cost system should pinpoint where production, market- 
ing, and research costs are inefﬁcient even in sub-parts of the 
operation. 

c.  C apital conservation through tight control of ﬁxed and work- 

ing capital investments. 

  7.   A critical ﬁnance function is to provide an early warning system 
to identify inﬂuences that could threaten the proﬁt plan sufﬁ- 
ciently ahead of time to devise remedial plans to minimize 
adverse surprises.

PEOPLE FACTORS 

  1.   To become more successful, a ﬁrm needs a leader with a deter-
mined  entrepreneurial  personality  combining  the  drive,  the 
original ideas, and the skills necessary to build the fortunes of the 
ﬁrm. 

  2.   A growth-oriented chief executive must surround himself with 
an  extremely  competent  team  and  to  delegate  considerable 
authority to them to run the activities of the ﬁrm. Teamwork, as 
distinct from dysfunction struggles for power, is critical. 

  3.   Attention  must  be  paid  to  attracting  competent  managers  at 
lower levels and to training them for larger responsibilities. Suc- 
cession should largely be from the available talent pool. The need 
to recruit the chief executive from outside is a particularly dan- 
gerous sign. 

  4.  The entrepreneurial spirit must permeate the organization. 
  5.   More  successful  ﬁrms  usually  have  some  unique  personality 
traits—some  special  ways  of  doing  things  that  are  particularly 
effective for their management team. This is a positive not a neg-
ative sign. 

  6.   Management must recognize and be attuned to the fact that the 
world in which they are operating is changing at an ever increas-
ing rate. 
a.  E very accepted way of doing things must be reexamined peri- 

odically, and new, better ways sought. 

b.  C hanges  in  managerial  approaches  involve  necessary  risks, 

which must be recognized, minimized and taken. 

  7.   There  must  be  a  genuine,  realistic,  conscious  and  continuous 
effort to have employees at every level, including the blue collar 
workers,  believe  that  their  company  is  really  a  good  place  to 
work. 
a.  E mployees must be treated with reasonable dignity and 

decency. 

b.   The ﬁrm’s work environment and beneﬁts programs should 

be supportive of motivation. 

c.   People must feel they can express grievances without fear and 
with  reasonable  expectation  of  appropriate  attention  and 
action. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2 8 2  

d.  P articipatory programs seem to work well and be an important 

source of good ideas. 

  8.   Management must be willing to submit to the disciplines required  
of sound growth. Growth requires some sacriﬁce of current proﬁts 
to lay the foundation for worthwhile future improvement. 

BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS 

  1.   Although managers rely heavily on return of assets in consider- 
ing new investments, investors must recognize that historic assets 
stated at historic costs distort comparisons of ﬁrms’ performance. 
Favorable  proﬁt  to  sales  ratios,  notwithstanding  differences  in 
turnover  ratios,  may  be  a  better  indicator  of  the  safety  of  an 
investment, particularly in an inﬂationary environment. 

  2.   High margins attract competition, and competition erodes proﬁt 
opportunities. The best way to mute competition is to operate so 
efﬁciently that there is no incentive left for the potential entrant. 
  3.   Efﬁciencies of scale are often counterbalanced by the inefﬁcien-
cies of bureaucratic layers of middle management. In a well-run 
ﬁrm,  however,  the  industry  leadership  position  creates  a  strong 
competitive advantage that should be attractive to investors. 
  4.   Getting there ﬁrst in a new product market is a long step toward 
becoming ﬁrst. Some ﬁrms are better geared to be there ﬁrst. 
  5.   Products  are  not  islands. There  is  an  indirect  competition,  for 
example, for consumers’ dollars. As prices change, some products 
may lose attractiveness even in well-run, low-cost companies. 
  6.   It  is  hard  to  introduce  new,  superior  products  in  market  arenas 
where  established  competitors  already  have  a  strong  position. 
While  the  new  entrant  is  building  the  production,  marketing 
power,  and  reputation  to  be  competitive,  existing  competitors  
can take strong defensive actions to regain the market threatened. 
Innovators have a better chance of success if they combine tech- 
nology disciplines, e.g., electronics and nucleonics, in a way that is 
novel relative to existing competitive competencies.

  7.   Technology is just one avenue to industry leadership. Developing 
a consumer “franchise” is another. Service excellence is still another. 
Whatever  the  case,  a  strong  ability  to  defend  established  markets 
against new competitors is essential for a sound investment.
